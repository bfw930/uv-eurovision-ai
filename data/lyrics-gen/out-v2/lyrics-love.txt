love was right and everything is right
love it all
love on-the-fly, joy on-the-fly
love to me
love, I need your love too
love, I don't care what the world may call me
love – even though it's sad
love in return
love can make you feel something
love that I have waited
love – and that's all that matters
love is your kiss for all time
love for everyone
love, love, love
love (still out of love)
love is love
love is so important
love – nothing can tear you apart
love is that beautiful thing you say
love is dancing with your wildest dreams
love is all we need
love is through love
love's going crazy
love is the good old days
love can give you all
love, your love is a fairy tale
love is living in peace
love is what makes you believe
love is everything I love
love can make you believe
love was love and love was hate
love is like pouring water
love my love, you are my everything
love me, make me beautiful
love can make you sweat, fight all over
love is a weapon and we will use it to our fury
love I might now
love is not me, it's you and me
love's beating down the beat
love I need to bring you love
love's a big thing
love is a flame
love will come back
love, love, love you really love
love me, love me forever
love, love, love
love all your life
love is not a thing
love we must share
love, oh love, I love you.
love feels like bliss
love is life
love is love for you
love – be the best, you were always my best
love is love, love is love
