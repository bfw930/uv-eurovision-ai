open, hold my heart
open your heart to me
open your heart, you're the one I hate
open my eyes, open my heart
open your heart and hope
open up your heart to mine
open up your heart, give up on our selfish dreams
open the door and I'll make it, alright
open a love book and ask me for it
open your eyes, this is who I am
open the door, no, it won't open the door (door)
open me in the memory, taking you in my dreams
open me in through my heart
open up your heart with love
open open wide, how are you?
open the door, but no one comes
open a heart on the wings of love
open in your heart like raindrops
open your heart to me
open the door
open a minute, oh come back to me
open your heart, I'm coming alive
open eyes, bent hands, bent arms
open our eyes and see we are free
open your heart, say: Earth is in harmony
open to see, no matter what may be between us
open a little darkness for me, look at me now
open up with love, I ain't scared no more
open with whatever you feel in your heart
open the distance between us and the stars
open up your heart and say it loud
open a cigarette, take a look around
open up your heart
open a little door that's ajar
open up your heart, come on with me and live my life like a butterfly
open a bag with your lover
open and close your eyes – it seems the world is beginning
open up your heart, show your emotions
open up your heart, keep it in my hands
openen playboy, et bleu playboy
open your eyes, you came with me
open the doorbell
open your heart to love
open up your heart, unite your colours
open up your heart for love
open a door, open the door
open the door
open my heart to you
open up your heart
open your heart, keep running free
open the door
open your eyes
open your eyes, I’ll be with you
open a world with you
open out of the blue
open up your heart to love
open your heart
open doors, but we won't give in
open the door, welcome the guest (Fly, babe)
open up the heart – I ain't scared no more
open the hope, you will find me
open the door
open up your heart for me, my love
