power to where I am tonight
power and zeal, darkness and hunger
power for you and me
power is making the sky blue
power to whom it’s given
power to hold all our rage (Holding all our rage)
power percolundian, when you pick a flower
powering your million or a million
powerces un noche
power to avenge,
power to all we want
power out of the blue
power, power of a king
power voltage – tell me where to go, tell me where to go
power of love
powerment, mon cœur qui te bailure
power to win over the weak
power by a thousand voltrellirs
power the tide with love
power me up
power to carry on
power of love, sole source of happiness
power of love, would you be there?
power to me
power of love
power to the people we help
power of love
powerlies at night
power we're trembling at the corner of Madrid, (Can't escape)
power to keep from harm
power my world round and start anew
power the world with magic
power for life
power I'm holding onto
power to the untouchable
power I'm holding on to
power to everybody, everybody
powerlessly, it's impossible to change
power, I need you
power power over Europe
power me off this...
power with me
power and strength are minha to
power (Stupid girl)
power by a thousand candles
power the world with light
power of love
power to feel that I’m alive
power of truth
power will make you want to cry
power of two stars
power and power of the fire
power to keep us strong
power to those around me
power to his fairies
power to the people that can take care
powerment, couleur parlé de nos réveillentions par rien
power to heal us
power to the earth
power (popular song), love (popular song)
power me, just hold me tight
power for free.
