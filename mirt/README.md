This folder contains code originally written for Uitdenbogerd's PhD work in melody matching, 
and subsequently used for MIREX entries.
For this project we use it to match melody and lyric stress strings, which were matched using global alignment with default settings (indels -2, mismatch -1)

Use melquery -h to see the options/documentation
