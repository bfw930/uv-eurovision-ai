2012 Sweden: Loreen – Euphoria
Why?
Why can’t this moment last forevermore?
Tonight…
Tonight eternity’s an open door.
No!
Don’t ever stop doing the things you do.
Don’t go!
In every breath I take I’m breathing you.
Euphoria,
Forever, ’till the end of time.
From now on, only you and I
We’re going up…
Euphoria,
An everlasting piece of art.
A beating love within my heart,
We’re going up…
We are here,
We’re all alone in our own Universe.
We are free,
Where everything’s allowed and love comes first.
Forever and ever, together,
We sail into infinity.
We’re higher and higher and higher,
We’re reaching for divinity.
Euphoria,
Forever, ’till the end of time.

Salvador Sobral – Amar Pelos Dois - English translation (Portugal 2017)
If one day someone asks about me
Tell them I lived to love you
Before you, I only existed
Tired and with nothing to give

My dear, listen to my prayers
I beg you to return, to want me again
I know that one can’t love alone
Maybe slowly you might learn again

My dear, listen to my prayers
I beg you to return, to want me again
I know that one can’t love alone
Maybe slowly you might learn again

If your heart doesn’t wish to give in
Not to feel passion, not to suffer
Without making plans of what will come after
My heart can love for the both of us

When strangers are coming
They come to your house
They kill you all
and say
We're not guilty
not guilty.

Jamala – 1944 (Ukraine 2016)
Where is your mind?
Humanity cries.
You think you are gods.
But everyone dies.
Don't swallow my soul.
Our souls...

We could build a future
Where people are free
to live and love.
The happiest time.
Our time...
Where is your heart?
Humanity rise.
You think you are gods
But everyone dies.
Don't swallow my soul
Our souls...

All alone in the danger zone
Are you ready to take my hand?
All alone in the flame of doubt
Are we going to lose it all?

Blanche – City Lights (Belgium 2017)
I could never leave
You and the city light
I could never beat
The storm in your eyes
The storm in your bright eyes
All alone in the danger zone
Are you ready to take my hand?
All alone in the flame of doubt
Are we going to lose it all?
Love came in between
The space in the city lights
Only I receive
The stars in your eyes
The stars in your dark eyes
All alone in the danger zone
Are you ready to take my hand?
All alone in the flame of doubt
Are we going to lose it all?
Let's put some light into our lives
But keep the storm that's in your eyes
Let's put some light into our lives
All alone in the danger zone
Are you ready to take my hand?
All alone in the flame of doubt
Are we going to lose it all?
All alone in the danger zone
Are you ready to take my hand?
All alone in the flame of doubt
Are we going to lose it all?
To lose it all
To lose it all

Il Volo – Grande amore (Italy 2015) (english translation)
I close my eyes and I think about her,
About the fragrance of her sweet skin.
There's a voice inside of me
Which brings me where the sun borns.
The words are lonely
But if you write them down, all can change...
Without any fear I want to scream to you about this great love.

Love..only love..it's what I feel...

Tell me, why when I think, I think only about you?
Tell me, why when I look, I see only you?
Tell me, why when I believe, I believe only in you, great love?

Tell me that never
That you will never leave me.
Tell me that you are
The breath of my days, of my love.
Tell me that you know
That you will choose only me.
Now you know
That you are my only great love.

Springs will fly away,
Cold and stupid days to remember,
Damned nights,
Lost in sleepless nights.
Others - in making love..
Love, you are my love,
Forever, for me.

Tell me, why when I think, I think only about you?
Tell me, why when I love, I love only you?
Tell me, why when I live, I live only in you, great love?

Tell me that you know
That you will choose only me.
Now you know
That you are my only great love...
Loïc Nottet – Rhythm Inside (Belgium 2015)
Listen to the sound of thunder
Rolling in the soul down under
Far beneath the skin it rumbles
Step to the step of the drum that rolls inside

Be you enemy or lover
We are put here to discover
Your heart that beats within each other

We're gonna rap-op-bop, rap-op-bop
We're gonna rap-op-bop tonight

And if we die tomorrow
What'll we have to show
For the wicked ways down below
The rhythm inside is telling us
We can fly tomorrow
On the beautiful wind that blows
On the cosmic track, love attack

I'm gonna get that rhythm back

Be you enemy or brother
We were put here to discover
Your heart that beats within each other

We're gonna rap-op-bop, rap-op-bop
We're gonna rap-op-bop tonight

And if we die tomorrow
What'll we have to show
For the wicked ways down below
The rhythm inside is telling us
We can fly tomorrow
On the beautiful wind that blows
On the cosmic track, love attack

I'm gonna get that rhythm back
We're gonna rap-op-bop, rap-op-bop
We're gonna rap-op-bop tonight
We're gonna rap-op-bop, rap-op-bop
We're gonna rap-op-bop tonight
We're gonna rap-op-bop, rap-op-bop
We're gonna rap-op-bop tonight
We're gonna rap-op-bop, rap-op-bop
We're gonna rap-op-bop tonight
And if we die tomorrow
What'll we have to show
For the wicked ways down below
The rhythm inside is telling us
We can fly tomorrow
On the beautiful wind that blows
On the cosmic track, love attack
I'm gonna get that rhythm back

Pastora Soler – Quédate conmigo (Spain 2012)
Sorry if I didn’t figure out
That it was you who was everything to me
Sorry for the pain
Forgive every tear
I know I don’t deserve more
But if I don’t have it here, I can’t live
Stay with me, don’t go
Forgive me if I did not know how to love you
It was not my heart
Stay with me, stay with me
If you are not here the sun will not come out
There are no memories of yesterday
Only the hours in your skin, loving you
Stay with me, don’t go
Forgive me if I did not know how to love you
It was not my heart
Stay with me, stay with me
If you are not here the sun will not come out
And now that I see you go
I know that I won’t forget
Forgive me if I did not know how to love you
It was not my heart
Stay with me, stay with me
If you are not here the sun will not come out
And now that I see you go
I know that I won’t forget
Stay with me, stay with me
If you are not here the sun will not come out

Sertab Erener – Everyway That I Can (Turkey 2003)
I feel you moving on a different course
Making the way for a distant coast
You say you love me and you roll your eyes
Turn to stare at the empty skies

I thought it was over and we'd pass all that
All we've done is to pass back to frame number one
Come on, now, now
I wanna show you all again what it would be like
If you just let go and let me love you
Everyway that I can
I'll try to make you love me again
Everyway that I can
I'll give you all my love and then
Everyway that I can
I'll cry, I'll die
Make you mine again
Hold me closer, oh, so good
You make me feel just like I should
I know what you're thinking: uhuh good
Now the rest of the world is overruled
Tell me what you see in other girls all around
Come on closer and tell me what you don't find here
Come on, now, now
I wanna be the everything you've been missing out
Just let go and let me love you
Everyway that I can
I'll try to make you love me again
Everyway that I can
I'll give you all my love and then
Everyway that I can
I'll cry, I'll die
Make you mine again
I'm in love with you
I'll do all you want me to
You make me wanna huhuh
Make me wanna huhuhuh
I'm in love with you
I'll do all you want me to
You make me wanna huhuh
Make me wanna huhuhuh
Nothing in the world that will stop me, no sir
Nothing in the world that will stop me, no sir
No, no, no, no, no
Everyway that I can
I'll try to make you love me again
Everyway that I can
I'll give you all my love and then
Everyway that I can
I'll give you all my love and then
Everyway that I can
I'll cry, I'll die
Make you mine again

ABBA – Waterloo (Sweden 1974)
My my
At Waterloo Napoleon did surrender
Oh yeah
And I have met my destiny in quite a similar way
The history book on the shelf
Is always repeating itself
Waterloo I was defeated, you won the war
Waterloo promise to love you for ever more
Waterloo couldn't escape if I wanted to
Waterloo knowing my fate is to be with you
Waterloo finally facing my Waterloo
My my
I tried to hold you back, but you were stronger
Oh yeah
And now it seems my only chance is giving up the fight
And how could I ever refuse
I feel like I win when I lose
Waterloo I was defeated, you won the war
Waterloo promise to love you for ever more
Waterloo couldn't escape if I wanted to
Waterloo knowing my fate is to be with you
Oh, oh Waterloo finally facing my Waterloo
So how could I ever refuse
I feel like I win when I lose
Waterloo couldn't escape if I wanted to
Waterloo knowing my fate is to be with you
Waterloo finally facing my Waterloo
Waterloo knowing my fate is to be with you
Oh, oh Waterloo finally facing my Waterloo
Waterloo knowing my fate is to be with you
Alexander Rybak – Fairytale (Norway 2009)
Years ago
When I was younger
I kinda liked
A girl I knew
She was mine and we were sweethearts
That was then but then it's true
I'm in love with a fairytale
Even though it hurts
Cause I don't care if
I lose my mind
I'm already cursed
Every day
We started fighting
Every night
We fell in love
No one else
Could make me sadder
But no one else
Could lift me high above
I don't know what I was doin'
But suddenly we fell apart
Nowadays
I cannot find her
But when I do
We'll get a brand new start
I'm in love with a fairytale
Even though it hurts
Cause I don't care if
I lose my mind
I'm already cursed
She's a fairytale
Yeaaah
Even though it hurts
Cause I don't care
If I lose my mind
I'm already cursed

Marija Šerifovic – Molitva (Serbia 2007)
It’s been a long way
I tried hard not to fall apart
Every night I pray
And your voice is singing in my heart

I have been waiting
A long time for you to take my hand
Loving and hating
A desire that I don’t understand

I can’t breath, I can’t sleep
Why can’t I get through to you?
I can’t think, I can’t speak
What am I to do?

Destiny
I’ve been looking for something to guide me
Destiny
Even though I’ve tried I can’t deny you
If I let you go, I’d betray my soul
I know that this is something more
Even though nothing’s spoken for,
a way that you will feel the same ‘bout me
Destiny

Read the stars and see my scars
I feel so low when you’re away
So reach out, it’s not far
Listen to me pray

Destiny
I’ve been looking for something to guide me
Destiny
Even though I tried I can’t deny you
If I let you go (let you go)
I betray my soul (my soul)
I know that this is something more
Even though (even though), nothing’s spoken for (spoken for)
A way that you will feel the same
’bout me.. ooohhh

If I let you go (let you go)
I betray my soul (my soul)
I know this is something more
Even though, (even though) nothing spoken for (spoken for)
I pray that you will feel the same ’bout me
Destiny
Faith is within me
Destiny
maNga – We Could Be the Same (Turkey 2010)
You could be the one in my dreams
You could be much more than you seem
Anything I wanted in life
Do you understand what I mean?
I can see that this could be faith
I can love you more than they hate
Doesn’t matter who they will blame
We can beat them at their own game
I can see it in your eyes
It doesn’t count as a surprise
I see you dancing like a star
No matter how different we are
For all this time I’ve been loving you
Don’t even know your name
For just one night, we could be the same
No matter what they say
And I feel I’m turning the page
And I feel the world is a stage
I don’t think that drama will stop
I don’t think they’ll give up the rage
But i know the world could be great
I can love you more than they hate
Doesn’t matter who they will blame
We can beat them at their own game
I can see it in your eyes
It doesn’t count as a surprise
I see you dancing like a star
No matter how different we are
For all this time I’ve been loving you
Don’t even know your name
For just one night, we could be the same
No matter what they say
For all this time I’ve been loving you
Don’t even know your name
For just one night, we could be the same
No matter what they say
No matter what they say
No matter what they say
We could be the same
No matter what they say


Elina Born & Stig Rästa – Goodbye to Yesterday (Estonia 2015)
I woke up at six a.m.
My eyes were closed but my mind was awake
Pretended I was breathing in a deep sleep pace

Got dressed so quietly
I was frozen by the jingle of my keys at the door
As I got outside I smiled to the dog

I didn’t wanna wake you up
My love was never gonna be enough
So, I took my things and got out of your way now, girl

Why didn’t you wake me up
I’m pretty sure I would have told you to stop
Let’s try again and say goodbye
Goodbye to yesterday

Why would you think like that?
Yeah, we fight a lot but in the end
You and I we’re a perfect match

I wouldn’t want it any other way
But now you’re gone and I’m all alone
Lying here naked and staring at the phone

I didn’t wanna wake you up
My love was never gonna be enough
So, I took my things and got out of your way now, girl

Why didn’t you wake me up
I’m pretty sure I would have told you to stop
Let’s try again and say goodbye
Goodbye to yesterday

I didn’t wanna wake you up
My love was never gonna be enough
So, I took my things and got out of your way now, girl

Why didn’t you wake me up
I’m pretty sure I would have told you to stop
Let’s try again and say goodbye

Goodbye to yesterday
Goodbye to yesterday
Oh, Goodbye to yesterday

Sergey Lazarev – You Are the Only One (Russia 2016)
We can never let the word be unspoken
We will never let our loving go come undone
Everything we had is staying unbroken, now
You will always be the only one
You're the only one
Won't ever give up 'cause you're
Still somewhere out there
Nothin' or no one's gonna keep us apart
Breakin' it down but I'm still gettin' nowhere
Won't stop, hold on
Thunder 'n' lightning it's gettin' excitin'
Lights up the skyline to show where you are
My love is rising the story's unwindin'
Together we'll make it 'n' reach for the stars
You're the only one, you're my only one
You're my life, every breath that I take
Unforgettable, so unbelievable
You're the only one, my only one
I could have told you to slow down 'n' stay down
I could have told you a secret, won't you keep it now
Thinking of making a showdown when love is found
Thinking of waiting till you're around
Won't ever give up 'cause you're
Still somewhere out there
Nothin' or no one's gonna keep us apart
Breakin' it down but I'm still gettin' nowhere
Won't stop, hold on
Thunder 'n' lightning it's gettin' excitin'
Lights up the skyline to show where you are
My love is rising the story's unwindin'
Together we'll make it 'n' reach for the stars
You're the only one, you're my only one
You're my life every breath that I take
Unforgettable, so unbelievable
You're the only one, my only one
You're my only one
Thunder 'n' lightning, it's gettin'excitin'
Lights up the skyline to show where you are
You're the only one, you're my only one
You're my life .every breath that I take
Unforgettable, so unbelievable
You're the only one, my only one

Måns Zelmerlöw – Heroes (Sweden 2015)
Don't tell the gods I left a mess
I can't undo what has been done
Let's run for cover
What if I'm the only hero left
You better fire off your gun
Once and forever
He said go dry your eyes
And live your life like there is no tomorrow son
And tell the others
To go sing it like a hummingbird
The greatest anthem ever heard
We are the heroes of our time
But we're dancing with the demons in our minds
We are the heroes of our time
Heroes
But we're dancing with the demons in our minds
Heroes
We are the heroes of our time
Heroes
But we're dancing with the demons in our minds
Heroes
The crickets sing a song for you
Don't say a word don't make a sound
It's life's creation
I make worms turn into butterflies
Wake up and turn this world around
In appreciation
He said I never left your side
When you were lost I followed right behind
Was your foundation
Now go sing it like a hummingbird
The greatest anthem ever heard
Now sing together
We are the heroes of our time
Heroes
But we're dancing with the demons in our minds
Heroes
We are the heroes
Now go sing it like a hummingbird
The greatest anthem ever heard
Now sing together
We are the heroes of our time
Heroes
But we're dancing with the demons in our minds
Heroes
We are the heroes of our time
Heroes
But we're dancing with the demons in our minds
Heroes
We are the heroes

Conchita Wurst – Rise Like a Phoenix (Austria 2014)
Waking in the rubble
Walking over glass
Neighbors say we're trouble
Well that time has passed
Peering from the mirror
No, that isn't me
Stranger getting nearer
Who can this person be
You wouldn't know me at all today from the fading light I fly
Rise like a phoenix
Out of the ashes seeking rather than vengeance
Retribution you were warned
Once I'm transformed
Once I'm reborn
You know I will rise like a phoenix
But you're my flame
Go about your business
Act as if you're free
No one could have witnessed
What you did to me
'Cause you wouldn't know me today
And you have got to see
To believe
From the fading light I fly
Rise like a phoenix
Out of the ashes seeking rather than vengeance
Retribution, you were warned
Once I'm transformed
Once I'm reborn
I rise up to the sky
You threw me down but
I'm gonna fly
And rise like a phoenix
Out of the ashes seeking rather than vengeance
Retribution you were warned
Once I'm transformed
Once I'm reborn
You know I will rise like a phoenix
But you're my flame

Dami Im – Sound of Silence (Australia 2016)
Growing tired and weary brown eyes
Trying to feel your love through face time
Symphonies of dreams and highlights
Caught up in this crazy fast life
But baby you're not here with me
And I keep calling calling
Keep calling 'cause
Now my heart awakes to the sound of silence
And it beats to the sound of silence
And it beats to the sound of silence
Now my heart awakes to the sound of silence
And it beats to the sound of silence
And it beats to the sound of silence
Getting hard to break through the madness
You're not here it never makes sense
Tidal waves of tears are crashing
No one here to save me drowning
'Cause baby you're not here with me
And I keep calling calling
Keep calling 'cause
Now my heart awakes to the sound of silence
And it beats to the sound of silence
And it beats to the sound of silence
Now my heart awakes to the sound of silence
And it beats to the sound of silence
And it beats to the sound of silence
I know I'm stronger and I'm capable
I know it's all in my head
But I keep calling calling
Calling calling
Now my heart awakes to the sound of silence
And it beats to the sound of silence
And it beats to the sound of silence
Now my heart awakes to the sound of silence
And it beats to the sound of silence
And it beats to the sound of silence

The Common Linnets – Calm After the Storm (The Netherlands 2014)
Driving in the fast lane
Counting mile marker signs
The empty seat beside me
Keeps you on my mind
Livin’ in the heartache
Was never something I pursued
I can’t keep on chasing
What I can’t be for you
Ooh skies are black and blue
I’m thinking about you
Here in the calm after the storm
Tears on the highway
Water in my eyes
This rain ain’t gonna change us
So what’s the use to cry?
I could say I’m sorry
But I don’t wanna lie
I just wanna know if staying
Is better than goodbye
Ooh skies are black and blue
I’m thinking about you
Here in the calm after the storm
Ooh after all that we’ve been through
There ain’t nothing new
Here in the calm after the storm
Maybe I can find you
Down this broken line
Maybe you can find me
Guess we’ll know in time
Ooh skies are black and blue
I’m thinking about you
Here in the calm after the storm
Ooh after all that we’ve been through
There ain’t nothing new
Here in the calm after the storm
There ain’t nothing new
Here in the calm after the storm
Helena Paparizou – My Number One (Greece 2005)
You're my lover
Undercover
You're my secret passion and I have no other

You're Delicious
So Capricious
If I find out you don't want me I'll be vicious

Say you love me
And you'll have me
In your arms forever and I won?t forget it

Say you miss me
Come and kiss me
Take me up to heaven and you won?t regret it

You are the one
You're my number one
The only treasure I'll ever have
You are the one
You're my number one
Anything for you 'cause you're the one I love

You re my lover
Undercover
You're my secret passion and I have no other

You're a fire
And desire
When I kiss your lips, you know, you take me higher

You're addiction
My conviction
You're my passion, my relief, my crucifixion

Never leave me
And believe me
You will be the sun into my raining season

Never leave me
And believe me
In my empty life you'll be the only reason
Poli Genova – If Love Was a Crime (Bulgaria 2016)
You and I, we collide
Like the stars on the summer night
We can shine forever
And you and we're alive
What we feel is what is right
We can run like never
If love was a crime then we would be criminals
Locked up for life but I'll do the time
If love was a crime then we would work miracles
High above the ground
They will never break us down
They will never break us down
They will never break us down
Never mind
Wrong or right
Our love ain't got no pride
So we change for better
Unafraid
Never fade
When it's dark we illuminate
When we rise together
If love was a crime then we would be criminals
Locked up for life but I'll do the time
If love was a crime then we would work miracles
High above the ground
They will never break us down
They will never break us down
They will never break us down
Together we're untouchable
You and me against the world
Together we're invincible
They will never break us down
They will never break us down
They will never break us down
Together we're untouchable
You and me against the world
Together we're invincible
Together we're untouchable
You and me against the world
Together we're invincible
They will never break us down

I'm not your toy, not your toy, not your toy, toy

Francesco Gabbani – Occidentali’s Karma (Italy 2017)
To be, or to have to be;
a Hamletic doubt.
Contemporary as the Neolithic man.
You're all comfy in your 2 x 3 cage.
Intellectuals in cafés -- experts of the internet,
honorary members of 'Selfie Addicts Anonymous'.
Intelligence is old-fashioned.
There are easy answers,
but pointless dilemmas.

A - A - A - we're looking for a story with a great ending,
we're hoping for it,
but whatever happens, panta rhei ((everything flows))
and “Singing in the Rain”.

Chorus:
Lessons of Nirvana,
You'll find Buddha standing in single file,
it's a time of fun for everyone - a time of glory! (ALE!)
The crowd's shouting a mantra,
yet evolution's stumbling along;
the naked ape is dancing the Westerner's Karma.
... Westerner's Karma.
The naked ape is dancing the Westerner's Karma.

Drops of Chanel pour on to sterile bodies
Save yourself from the smell of those around you!
Everyone's a spin-doctor with the web in their pocket,
Cocaine for the masses - an opiate for the poor.

A - A- A - we're looking for a virtual humanity,
Sex appeal,
but whatever happens, "panta rhei" ((everything flows))
and “Singing in the Rain”.

Lessons of Nirvana,
You'll find Buddha standing in single file,
it's a time of fun for everyone - a time of glory! (ALE!)
The crowd's shouting a mantra,
yet evolution's stumbling along;
the naked ape is dancing the Westerner's Karma.
... Westerner's Karma.
The naked ape is dancing the Westerner's Karma.

When our life is distracted,
Men fall down,
Westerner's karma...
Westerner's karma...
The ape is rising up!
Namaste! ALE!

Lessons of Nirvana,
You'll find Buddha standing in single file,
it's a time of fun for everyone - a time of glory! (ALE!)
The crowd's shouting a mantra,
yet evolution's stumbling along;
the naked ape is dancing the Westerner's Karma.
... Westerner's Karma.
The naked ape is dancing the Westerner's Karma.

Sebnem Paker – Dinle (Turkey 1997)

The days don't pass on without you
and my nights are lonely
Ah my love, Where are you and who are you with?
I can't dare to ask you, so listen!

I love you without asking if there is an end to this crazy love
and I would find you before the pain goes, the night ends, and
find you without going out

I know you without asking if you have a name, or if we meant to be
and i love you before it s heard and known by people, before I smile at them

(should have asked) if got a name?
(really) if we are meant to be?
(should have known) if there is an end?
(Quietly) I love you



Mørland & Debrah Scarlatt – A Monster Like Me (Norway 2015)
Honey, I'm telling the truth
I did something terrible in my early youth
My mind went blank, I lost control
I was just a little boy, I did not know
I better let you go
To find the prince you thought you found in me
I better set you free and give you up
Just wave and say goodbye and let you live
Without a monster like me
Honey, what am I to do?
I have pulled the trigger on this awful truth
Oh, hold me now 'cause I'm burning up
Sing this song so beautiful, just make it stop
I better let you go
To find the prince you thought you found in me
I better set you free and give you up
Just wave and say goodbye and let you live
Without a monster like me
Oh… oh…
Oh… oh…
Just go
To find the prince you thought you found in me
I better set you free and give you up
Just wave and say goodbye and let you live
Without a monster like me, oh
Without a monster like me

Aminata – Love Injected (Latvia 2015)
You bring The light To My darkest side, babe
The day, The night, Split
To cure the sight, Oh…
You care, You animate, You guard me bare
Bring up the heart rate
Your love, Revives my soul
And I know You'll choose it whole Overall
Your eye's a good mirror
Look under the cover
Love Is above all
I'm safe Into your hands.
Let's move away
The edges expand
Your love Revives my soul
And I know You'll choose it whole Overall
Show me the source of the light
I'm becoming affected
Seeing the glow of a white
Is what I have detected
Feeling again I'm alive
It's your shining reflected
Love injected, love injected
Your love Revives my soul
And I know You'll choose it whole Overall
Your love Revives my soul
And I know You'll choose it whole Overall


Urban Symphony – Rändajad (Estonia 2009) English Translation
In the desert heat, the sand
blows like ice-cold snow
The night soon spreads its wings
Nothing but the wind to escort the nomads
That is the way they wander from one day to the next
That is the way they wander from one life to the next
That is the way it weaves an invisible path
on them, it waits until you are ready to take the risk
It carries only frozen souls
The moonlight makes their shadows
Warmth in a ray of sunlight
is what the morning brings once again
That is the way they wander from one day to the next
That is the way they wander from one life to the next
That is the way it weaves an invisible path
on them, it waits until you are ready to take the risk
They wander from one day to the next
They wander from one life to the next
It weaves an invisible path
It waits until you are ready to take the risk
A voice echoes across the mountains up to the heavens
That is the way they wander from one day to the next
That is the way they wander from one life to the next
That is the way it weaves an invisible path
on them, it waits until you are ready to take the risk
That is the way

Secret Garden – Nocturne (Norway 1995)

Let day have
it's rest now
and night will wake over it
Nocturne

See the darkness must
At one point end
So the night can give birth to a day

Ermal Meta & Fabrizio Moro – Non mi avete fatto niente (Italy 2018) (English Translation)
In Cairo they don't know what time it is,
the sun over Rambla isn't the same.
In France there is a concert, people are having fun,
someone is singing loudly, someone is shouting "Kill them".

In London it always rains, but today it doesn't do any harm.
The sky doesn't make discounts, not even at a funeral.
In Nice the sea is red of blood and guilt,
of people on the road and blood in the sewer.

And this huge body that we call "Earth",
hurt in it's organs from Asia to England.
Galaxies of people lost in space
but the most important one is the space of a hug.

Of mothers without children, of children without fathers,
of lit up faces, like walls without paintings.
Minutes of silence, interrupted by a voice:
"You haven't done anything to me".

You haven't done anything to me.
You haven't done anything to me.
This is my life that keeps going on,
above all, above people.

You haven't done anything to me.
You haven't done anything to me.
Because everything goes over
your useless wars.

There are people that sign a cross, people who pray on carpets,
the churches and mosques, the imam and all the priests,
entrances separated by the same house,
millions of people hoping in something.

Arms without hands, faces without names,
lets swap our skin, because in the end we are all humans.
Because our life is not a point of view
and there is no such thing as a pece bomb.

You haven't done anything to me.
You haven't done anything to me.
This is my life that keeps going on,
above all, above people.

You haven't done anything to me.
You haven't done anything to me.
Because everything goes over
your useless wars.

Skyscrapers will fall, the undergrounds,
the walls of contrast, lifted up for some bread.
But against every terror that makes a hurdle in our path
the world gets back up with a smile like that of a child's,
with a child's smile,
with a child's smile.

You haven't done anything to me.
You haven't done anything to me.
Because everything goes over
your useless wars.

You haven't done anything to me.
Your useless wars.
You haven't taken anything from me.
Your useless wars.
You haven't done anything to me.
Your useless wars.
You haven't had anything.
Your useless wars.

I am aware that nothing will come back.
Happiness flew
like a bubble flies aways.

Emmelie de Forest – Only Teardrops (Denmark 2013)
The sky is red tonight
We're on the edge tonight
No shooting star to guide us
Eye for an eye, why tear each other apart?
Please tell me why, why do we make it so hard?
Look at us now, we only got ourselves to blame
It's such a shame
How many times can we win and lose?
How many times can we break the rules between us?
Only teardrops
How many times do we have to fight?
How many times till we get it right between us?
Only teardrops
So come and face me now
Here on the stage tonight
Let's leave the past behind us
Eye for an eye, why tear each other apart?
Please tell me why, why do we make it so hard?
Look at us now, we only got ourselves to blame
It's such a shame
Tell me, how many times can we win and lose?
How many times can we break the rules between us?
Only teardrops
How many times do we have to fight?
How many times till we get it right between us?
Only teardrops
What's gone between us has come between us
Only teardrops
(Tell me now) What's gone between us has come between us
How many times can we win and lose?
How many times can we break the rules between us?
Only teardrops
How many times do we have to fight?
How many times till we get it right between us?
Only teardrops, only teardrops
Only teardrops
Only teardrops
How many times can we win and lose?
How many times can we break the rules between us?
Only teardrops
How many times do we have to fight?
How many times till we get it right between us?
Only teardrops


Michal Szpak – Color of Your Life (Poland 2016)
When loneliness is knocking on your door
Everything you loved just disappears
And when you feel that everything is lost
You need to know there’s no life without tears
Oh… tell me black or white
What colour is your life?
Oh… try to ask your heart
Who you really are
No one is forever beautiful and young
Everything you know just disappears
Fame and gold are nothing you can be sure
When there is no love in your heart
The choice is yours, who you really want to be?
Don’t be afraid of your destiny
So when you feel that everything is lost
You need to know there’s no life without fear
Oh… tell me black or white
What colour is your life?
Oh… try to ask your heart
Who you really are
Every day we must fight with the wind
We have to live
All these things are just empty desire
‘Cause there’s no smoke without fire
Oh… tell me black or white
What colour is your life?
Oh… try to ask your heart
Who you really are
Oh… tell me black or white
What colour is your life?
Oh… try to ask your heart
What colour is your life?

Sanna Nielsen – Undo (Sweden 2014)
Silent, I can't wait here silent
Working up a storm inside my head
Nothing, I just stood for nothing
So I fell for everything you said
Hear the rumble
Hear my voice
Silent, I can't wait here silent
Gotta make a change and make some noise
Undo my sad
Undo what hurts so bad
Undo my pain
Gonna get out, through the rain
I know that I am over you
At last I know what I should do
Undo my sad
Trouble, baby I'm in trouble
Everytime I look into your eyes
Save me, oh I'm gonna save me
Far away from all the crazy lies
Hear the rumble
Hear my voice
Undo my sad
Undo what hurts so bad
Undo my pain
Gonna get out, through the rain
I know that I am over you
At last I know what I should do
Undo my sad

Iveta Mukuchyan – LoveWave (Armenia 2016)
Hey, it's me
Look, I know it might sound strange
But suddenly I'm not the same I used to be
It's like I've stepped out of space
And time and come alive
Guess this is what it's all about cause
When it touched me the world went silent
Calm before the storm reaches me
The ground in motion set off all sirens
You took over my heartbeat
It's taking over me
You Shake my life like an earthquake now I'm waking up
You Gave me faith now I can break every single wall
You Prove we can do it all when all is out of love
You like a love wave
Spread a love wave and my heart goes ba-ba-da-bu-who-oh-oh
Caught in a downward spiral
I lost my soul in my dreams
I would give up and lose all trials
When one moment changed everything
Without even a single warning
I'm not who I was before
A chain reaction with no returning
Now watch me craving for more
It's taking over me
It's taking, it's taking over me
You like a love wave
Shake my life like an earthquake now I'm waking up
You like a love wave
Gave me faith now I can break every single wall
You like a love wave
Prove we can do it all when all is out of love
You like a love wave
Spread a love wave and my heart goes ba-ba-da-bu-who-oh-oh

Željko Joksimovic & Ad-Hoc Orchestra – Lane moje (Serbia & Montenegro 2004)
When I think of you
I'm afraid of loving you again
I sink my teeth into my blue lips
To forget the real pain
My sweetheart, these days
I don't even wallow in sorrow any more
I only ask if you are alone
People I can't hear
My sweetheart, leave tonight
It's not important, with anyone
Find someone who resembles me
So at least I won't love you
(May someone else kiss your lips)
(So I can get over you more easily)
My sweetheart, these days (My sweetheart)
I don't even wallow in sorrow any more (My sweetheart)
I only ask if you are alone
People I can't hear
My sweetheart, leave tonight (My sweetheart)
It's not important, with anyone
Find someone who resembles me
So at least I won't love you
So I will no longer love you

Margaret Berger – I Feed You My Love (Norway 2013)
A cocoon in a silent tree
Through the dark night you listen to me
When I whisper broken words in your ear
And you push, you push me hard to the surface
I’m blinded at heart but you wake me
You wake me up from the snow where I was born
Now I can see
The whole world is mine
I can touch and feel
I feed you my love
You put a knife against my back
And you dare me to face the attack
You say, “For cowards there’s no reward”
Feel the heat
Take my hand, I trust your word
Bring the fire, I don’t care if it hurts
I have the future on my tongue
Give me a kiss
Now I can see
The whole world is mine
I can touch and feel
So I feed you my love
You put a knife against my back
And you dare me to face the attack
You say, “For cowards there’s no reward”
I have the future on my tongue
Now I can see oh
The whole world is mine
I can touch and feel
So I feed you my love
Feed you my love
So I feed you my love

Eugent Bushpepa – Mall (Albania 2018)
This yearning for years that thrills and that sears
Some footsteps ring out like a heartbeat tonight
I hear their rhythm match mine
Two arms that reach out and engulf me with warmth
This yearning that burns knows no distance, no bounds in this world
No words can describe the feeling that grows up inside
When to hearts unite and they beat as one
Lingering tear, light up this night
Find your way out, to soothe my soul
Just for one day make this pain subside
This lingering tear, one day will run dry
From fiery kisses I dream every night
Then at last pain will fade away
I wanna lay in my bed in this silent night
Where dreams are devine and they bring peace of mind
To see, the vision of her
The moments pass by with merciless cry
The hours, they fly, the feeling still lingers –on
This night the moon captures the gazes we share
Weaving a vision of you, though it is just fantasy
I’ll give my life to you
Lingering tear, light up this night
Find your way out, to soothe my soul
Just for one day make this pain subside
This lingering tear, one day will run dry
From fiery kisses I dream every night
Then at last pain will fade away
Fade away



Yohanna – Is It True? (Iceland 2009)
You say you really know me
you’re not afraid to show me
what is in your eyes
So tell me about the rumors
Are they only rumors?
Are they only lies?
Falling out of a perfect dream, coming out of the blue
Is it true? Is it over?
Did I throw it away? Was it you?
Did you tell me you would never leave me this way?
If you really knew me
You couldn’t do this to me
You would be my friend
If one of us is lying
There’s no use in trying
No need to pretend
Falling out of a perfect dream, coming out of the blue
Is it true? Is it over?
Did I throw it away? Was it you?
Did you tell me you would never leave me this way?
Is it true? Is it over?
Did I throw it away? Was it you?
Did you tell me you would never leave me this way?
Is it real? Did I dream it?
Will I wake from this pain
Is it true? Is it over?
Baby did I throw it away?
Ooh, is ït true?

Hari Mata Hari – Lejla (Bosnia & Herzegovina 2006)
I can smell the wind down the meadow
And pain follows me like a shadow
Are you still somewhere longing for me?
Where are you hidden from me?
Put rosemary in your hair
And a flower by the old fountain
Layla, how could you love another?
Dove, my dove
Carry the tears to her instead of the song
If tomorrow they ask for your hand
You should know I wont be there
Sorrows are easily forgiven
but only love never is
How could you love another?
Dove, my dove
Carry the tears to her instead of the song
I’m leaving as if I was guilty
of loving the one I’m not allowed
Dove, my dove
Carry the tears to her instead of the song
I’m leaving as if I was guilty
of loving the one I’m not allowed
Of loving you
Layla

Elina Nechayeva – La Forza (Estonia 2018)
You know, there's a star
In the night for me,
It lights up my way
To eternity,
It's my guide,
That never leaves me
In the immensity

The power of destiny
Makes me hover,
The time of happiness is near,
Is our affinity
A dream or reality
On the pink wings of Love

When I go down this road,
I always feel free,
I wish everything around us was
A fairytale,
Our love
Will be our guide
To the infinity,
Eternally

The power of destiny
Makes me hover,
The time of happiness is near,
Is our affinity
A dream or reality
On the pink wings of Love
Lena – Satellite (Germany 2010)
I went everywhere for you
I even did my hair for you
I bought new underwear, they’re blue
And I wore ’em just the other day
Love, you know I’ll fight for you
I left on the porch light for you
Whether you are sweet or cruel
I’gonna love you either way
Love, oh, love, I gotta tell you how I feel about you
‘Cause I, oh, I can’t go a minute without your love
Like a satellite, I’m in an orbit all the way around you
And I would fall out into the night
Can’t go a minute without your love
Love, I got it bad for you
I saved the best I have for you
You sometimes make me sad and blue
Wouldn’t have it any other way
Love, my aim is straight and true
Cupid’s arrow is just for you
I even painted my toe nails for you
I did it just the other day
Love, oh, love, I gotta tell you how I feel about you
‘Cause I, oh, I can’t go a minute without your love
Like a satellite I’m in an orbit all the way around you
And I would fall out into the night
Can’t go a minute without your love
Oh, love, I gotta tell you how I feel about you
‘Cause I, oh, I can’t go a minute without your love
Where you go, I’ll follow
You set the pace, we’ll take it fast and slow
I’ll follow in your way,
You got me, you got me
A force more powerful than gravity
It’s physics, there’s no escape
Love, my aim is straight and true
Cupid’s arrow is just for you
I even painted my toe nails for you
I did it just the other day
Love, oh, love, I gotta tell you how I feel about you
‘Cause I, oh, I can’t go a minute without your love
Like a satellite I’m in orbit all the way around you
And I would fall out into the night
Can’t go a minute without your
Love, oh, love, I gotta tell you how I feel about you
‘Cause I, oh, I can’t go a minute without your love
Love, love, love, love, love

Kristian Kostov – Beautiful Mess (Bulgaria 2017)
When the world shakes us
Trying to take us out of line
Fear of tomorrow
Feelings we borrow for a time
Water so deep, how do we breath?
How do we climb?
So we stay in this mess
This beautiful mess tonight
And we don't have a thing to lose
No matter what they say or do
I don't want nothing more
Our love is untouchable
Even in the line of fire
When everything is on the wire
Even up against the wall
Our love is untouchable
Our love is untouchable
When the colours turn grey
And the lights all fade to black again
We're in over our heads
But somehow we make it back again
Water so deep, how do we breath?
How do we climb?
So we stay in this mess
This beautiful mess tonight
And we don't have a thing to lose
No matter what they say or do
I don't want nothing more
Our love is untouchable
Even in the line of fire
When everything is on the wire
Even up against the wall
Our love is untouchable
Our love is untouchable



Katrina & The Waves – Love Shine a Light (United Kingdom 1997)
Love shine a light in every corner of my heart
Let the love light carry, let the love light carry
Light up the magic in every little part let our love
Shine a light in every corner of our hearts
Love shine a light in every corner of my dream
Let the love light carry, let the love light carry
Like the mighty river flowing from the stream
Let our love shine a light in every comer of our dreams
And we're all gonna shine a light together
All shine a light to light the way
Brothers and sisters in every little part
Let our love shine a light in every corner of our hearts
Love shine a light in every corner of the world
Let the love light carry let the love light carry
Light up the magic for every boy and girl
Let our love shine a light in every corner of the world
And we're all gonna shine a light together
All shine a light to light the way
Brothers and sisters in every little part
Let our love shine a light in every corner of our hearts

Madame Monsieur – Mercy (France 2018) (translated)
I was born this morning, my name is Mercy
In the middle of the sea, between two countries, Mercy
It was a long way and mom took it
She had me in my skin eight months and a half
Oh yes, eight and a half months
We left the house, it was the war
She was right, there was nothing to lose
Oh no, except life
I was born this morning, my name is Mercy

was reached out and I'm alive I'm all these children that the sea took
I will live a hundred thousand years, my name is Mercy
And there, before our eyes, was the enemy
A blue immensity maybe infinite
But yes, we knew the price
Emerging from a wave, a friendly ship
A gave back our chance to our survival
That's where I pushed my first cry
I was born this morning, my name is Mercy

was reached out and I'm alive I'm all these children that the sea took
I will live a hundred thousand years, my name is Mercy
I was born this morning, my name is Mercy
Thank you, thank you, thank
you, thank you Thank you, thank you, I'm fine, thank
you Thank you, thank you, thank
you, thank you Thank you, thank you, I'm fine, thank you
Thank you, thank you, thank
you, thank you Thank you, thank you, I'm fine, thank
you Thank you, thank you, thank
you, thank you Thank you, thank you, I'm fine, thank you

Polina Gagarina – A Million Voices (Russia 2015)
We are the worlds people
Different yet we're the same
We believe
We believe in a dream
Praying for peace and healing
I hope we can start again
We believe
We believe in a dream

We can sing
We can shine
When you hear our voices call
You won't be lonely anymore

Burning brighter than the sun
A million voices
Now as the world is listening
From cities and satellites

In a dream

Together like the stars in the sky
We can sing
We can shine
When you hear our voices call
You won't be lonely anymore
A million voices
Your heart is like a beating drum
Burning brighter than the sun
When I look around at these faces
I can see the stars in the sky
We will sing
We will shine
Singing out
Singing out
Oh
Singing out
Singing out
Ooh
Singing out
A million voices

AWS – Viszlát nyár (Hungary 2018) (translation)

Let’s lay our cards on the table
My vessel’s headed outbound
And it will leave you behind

My blood will keep running in your veins
If you won’t trade it away, there’ll be mark on your heart
That lifts you to the sky from the ground

Summer gone, now you’re all too late
That you’ll be mine was just a lie
You never came

Dreams all gone, thanks for fading away!
It’s about time that you repay
All you chose to take

I’m washed out and weary
You’re still holding on,
But, please, let go of me

You can tear off your fair share of me,
If you won’t trade it away, there’ll be mark on your heart
That lifts you to the sky from the ground

Antique – Die for You (Greece 2001)
I sat down and thought
Realised that you love me
Only you, only you
Everything else is a lie
Just your warm hug
Keeps me alive
'Cause I would die for you
Look into my eyes and see it's true
Really, I could never lie to you
Just to make you see that
No one else could ever love you like the way I do
Die for you
Look into my eyes and see it's true
Really, I could never lie to you
Just to make you see that
No one else could ever love you like the way I do
I sat down and thought
Realised that you love me
Only you, only you
'Cause I would die for you
Look into my eyes and see it's true
Really, I could never lie to you
Just to make you see that
No one else could ever love you like the way I do
Die for you
Look into my eyes and see it's true
Really, I could never lie to you
Just to make you see that
No one else could ever love you like the way I do
'Cause I would die for you

Ani Lorak – Shady Lady (Ukraine 2008)
You've been my superstar
But it's not what you are
You've been my super hero
Since I've lived in your shade
Every step that I made
Brought me nothing but zero

But I'm staying alive
And now I'm changin' my life
With a burning desire
No one knows who I am
But I don't give a damn
Gonna set you on fire

Shady lady – I'm gonna strike like thunder
Are you ready? I wanna make you wonder
Rollin' steady – I'm gonna make you shiver
My heart is burning

Shady lady – I'm gonna strike like thunder
Are you ready? I wanna make you wonder
Rollin' steady – I'm gonna make you shiver
My heart is burning now

Just take a look at me
Deep inside and you'll see
All I kept under cover
There is one thing I bet
You're about to regret
I'm no longer your lover

I've just turned one more page
I belong to the stage
Baby, don't call me baby

Shady lady – I'm gonna strike like thunder
Are you ready? I wanna make you wonder
Rollin' steady – I'm gonna make you shiver
My heart is burning now

(Shady lady)
(Shady lady)

I wanna light you up and leave you alone
I am a brand new star that you've never known
I wanna light you up and leave you alone
I am a brand new star that you've never known

(Shady lady)
(Are you ready?)

Shady lady – I'm gonna strike like thunder
Are you ready? I wanna make you wonder
Rollin' steady – I'm gonna make you shiver
My heart is burning now

Shiri Maimon – Hasheket Shenish’ar (Israel 2005)
With dozen lonely nights in my empty bed
Waiting for your touch, drying tears instead
I can’t forget them, promises you made had no faith
You never really kept them and now it’s goodbye

?Now that love is gone, where do I belong
Was it right or wrong? Look at me now

Finally I know it’s time to say goodbye
Suddenly all by myself I feel alive
I can’t live a lie, no reason to cry
…But now it’s just time
(It’s time to say goodbye)

Finally tonight (I know) I feel alive
I can’t live a lie, no reason to cry
…But now it’s just time
(And now it’s time to say goodbye)

Anabel Conde – Vuelve conmigo (Spain 1995)

I've felt the emptiness
And a sleeping memory arouses again
You're not with me
And so much loneliness is hurting me inside
Who knows where you are?
Who knows where you are?

Come, come, come back to me
Come, come, because I need your love
Come, I can't forget you
Come back to me, my love

Nothing remains in my soul
Except for this flame that will never die
That burns in my chest
When, alone in my bed
I feel you're not there
You have to listen to me
You have to listen to me

Come, come, come back to me
Come, come, because I need your love
Come, come back to me
Give heat to this winter

Come, come, come back to me
Come, come, I've already asked your forgiveness
(Come) Come, I can't forget you
Come back to me, my love

Oh... (Come, come, come back to me)
(Come, come, because I need your love)
Come, come, come (Come, come, come back to me)
(Give this winter heat) Oh, yeah, yeah

Come, come, come back to me
Come, come, I've already asked your forgiveness
(Come) Come, I can't forget you
Come back to me, my love

Lordi – Hard Rock Hallelujah (Finland 2006)
Was it already there in the womb?
Were we pulled out way too soon?
Were we quiet too long? Were we too small?
Or were we dropped on the floor?
Could it be something we ate?
Did they let us stay up too late?
Were there not enough rules?
Did we get too much love?
Was it something they taught us at school?
Cause inside something bad's awakened
The evil opens it's eyes
The temper's rising and the house is shaking
To get out is no longer an option
These are the deeds of the beast
We're the kids who wanna play with the dead
(Woah-woah!)
We must have lost our minds'
Cause we might lose our heads
We're the kids who wanna play with the dead
(Woah-woah!)
See us, pretty brides, and the evil we wed
Oh Lord, we play with the dead
Was it something we saw on TV?
The films that were gross and obscene?
Is it the clothes and the black-dyed hair,
Or were we just not aware?
There must have been some dangerous toys
And the music sings of murderous ploys
It's not like we did not have a choice
Backward masking gives the devil a voice
Cause inside something bad's awakened
The evil opens it's eyes
The temper's rising and the house is shaking
To get out is no longer an option
These are the deeds of the beast
We're the kids who wanna play with the dead
(Woah-woah!)
We must have lost our minds'
Cause we might lose our heads
We're the kids who wanna play with the dead
(Woah-woah!)
See us, pretty brides, and the evil we wed
Oh Lord, we play with the dead
To get out is no longer an option
These are the deeds of the beast
We're the kids who wanna play with the dead
(Woah-woah!)
We must have lost our minds'
Cause we might lose our heads
We're the kids who wanna play with the dead
(Woah-woah!)
See us, pretty brides, and the evil we wed
Oh Lord, now we wanna play with the dead
We lose our heads
Now we wanna play with the dead
We lose our heads
Oh Lord, oh Lord
Oh Lord, now we play with the dead

Jelena Tomaševic – Oro (Serbia 2008)
Who is caressing, my dear one
Who is waking up those sleepy lips
Don’t forget my name
when she starts, starts to kiss you,
My wheat, do not sleep,
kiss him, put me to sleep
Do not break my ice, it lacks water
Do not put salt on my wound, there are no tears
Who is dancing my hora
They should not dance for the two of us
My wheat, put me to sleep
Nuna ney, nuna nuna nuna nuna nuna ney,
Wake me up on St.Vitus’ day, so that I can look at him again
Wake me up on St.Vitus’ day, so that I can see him one more time
Equinox – Bones (Bulgaria 2018)
Love is like a black hole
Everything is dark
You just gotta let go
And feel it, feel it, feel it
We fall off the deep end
Just to get a rush
You know that it’s right when
You feel it, feel it, feel it
What is life
If it’s just of the earth
Only of the flesh and bones
Wanna thrive in the dust
Of the universe and way
Into unknown
So I love beyond the bones
Goes deep inside your soul
I love beyond the bones
I love beyond the bones
I love beyond the bones
Wanna be the fire
Even if it burns
Offer up my fibers
To feel it, feel it, feel it
What is life
If it’s just of the earth
Only of the flesh and bones
Wanna thrive in the dust
Of the universe and way
Into unknown
So I love beyond the bones
Goes deep inside your soul
I love beyond the bones
Goes deep inside your soul
I love beyond the bones
I love beyond the bones
I love beyond the bones
I love beyond the bones
Into the unknown
Into the unknown
Where no other love goes
I love, I love beyond the bones


Željko Joksimovic – Nije ljubav stvar (Serbia 2012) (translation)

Better luck next time
Saying it to me so easily
I can see we're not doing fine
And we could've done it all much better
And if you go away, there'll be something yours
remaining here

Love is not a thing
so I could give it back to you
Look, it's just me
I've always loved you
Love is not a thing
to not know what to do with it
I wish you all the best
This love is
my shipwreck only

Your love is not a thing
so I could give it back to you
Look, it's just me
I've always loved you
My love is not a thing
to not know what to do with it
I wish you all the best
It's my shipwreck only

Go, just, just go there,
Fly, sing, give your heart to somebody else
But keep in mind that Good Bye is not the end
My love is not a thing
to not know what to do with it
I wish you all the best
This love is my shipwreck only

Eric Saade – Popular (Sweden 2011)
Stop, don't say that it's impossible
'Cause I know it's possible
Though I know you never look my way
I can say, you will one day
I can say, you will one day
I will be popular, I will be popular
I'm gonna get there, popular
My body wants you girl, my body wants you girl
I'll get you when I'm popular
I'll put my hands up in the lights
You'll see me dancing for my life
I will be popular, I will be popular
I'm gonna get there, popular
Spread the news, I'm gonna take the fight
For the spotlight day and night
I can't take this to the number one
Be someone before you're gone
Be someone before you're gone
I will be popular, I will be popular
I'm gonna get there, popular
My body wants you girl, my body wants you girl
I'll get you when I'm popular
I'll put my hands up in the lights
You'll see me dancing for my life
I will be popular, I will be popular
I'm gonna get there, popular
Oh-oh-pop oh-oh-pop oh-oh-popular
Oh-oh-pop oh-oh-pop oh-oh-popular
Oh-oh-pop oh-oh-pop oh-oh-popular
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-ooh
I will be popular, I will be popular
I'm gonna get there
My body wants you girl, my body wants you girl
I'll get you when I'm popular
I'll put my hands up in the lights
You'll see me dancing for my life
I will be popular, I will be popular
Popular

Anne-Marie David – Tu te reconnaîtras (Luxembourg 1973) (translate)
In childhood dreams
In the pupil that the teacher punished
In the station where begin
The first life adventure

In the one who doubt
In the one who trust

You'll see, you'll recognize yourself
At every moment in each joy, in each tear
You'll see, you'll recognize yourself
In this child, among these people, all such as you

In the artist's dreams
That glory has never crowned
In this selfish world
Who denies what he loved

In those who are afraid
In those who are cold

You'll see, you'll recognize yourself
At every moment in each joy, in each tear
You'll see, you'll recognize yourself
In this child, among these people, all such as you

You'll see, you'll recognize yourself
In this love that I have for you
Yes, you'll see, you'll recognize yourself

Rona Nishliu – Suus (Albania 2012) (translation)

In this world, where love does not exist any more
Time has no time for us, no
No oh oh, oh oh
No oh oh oh… no oh oh oh…
There’s no hope to shine a light, no

This drowned world does not allow
To dream our dreams and live our lives
Withered souls and riftless minds

Make me believe this in my mind
Our past resolved and our future’s cold
Our time has passed, we betrayed our oath
Yet the world remains the same and I shed another tear

So just let me cry… cry… cry…
‘Cause I know every day will say I’m still alive
‘Cause I know every tear will say I’m still alive

Oh do do do do do…
Mmm ba do do do do…

So just let me cry… cry… cry…
‘Cause I know every day will say I’m still alive
‘Cause I know every tear will say I’m still alive

France Gall – Poupée de cire, poupée de son (Luxembourg 1965)
I'm a wax doll, a sawdust doll
My heart is engraved in my songs
Wax doll, sawdust doll
Am I better, am I worse than a fashion doll?
I see life through bright rosy-tinted glasses
Wax doll, sawdust doll
My records are a mirror
In which everyone can see me
I'm everywhere at once
Broken in a thousand pieces of voice
Around me, I hear the rag dolls laughing
Those who dance to my songs
Wax doll, sawdust doll
They give in to a yes, to a name
Love is not only in songs
Wax doll, sawdust doll
My records are mirrors
In which everyone can see me
I'm everywhere at once
Broken in thousand pieces of voice
Alone, sometimes I sigh
I say to myself: "What good"
"Singing about love this way for no reason"
"Without knowing anything of boys?"
I'm nothing but a wax doll, but a sawdust doll
Under the sun of my blond hair
Wax doll, sawdust doll
But one day I'll live my songs
Wax doll, sawdust doll
Without fearing the warmth of boys
Wax doll, sawdust doll

Mélovin – Under The Ladder (Ukraine 2018)
Curtains down, I'm laughing at the trial
Help me to unravel
Tangle of my innocence inside
Faith's 'bout to be severed
Oh oh oh oh
Won't get any better
Oh oh oh oh
Walk under the ladder
Shout out just one reason what's this for
You can see that whatever the weather
That the wind's always there, always fair
Oh oh oh oh
And it always has been now or never
The decision has got to be made
Oh oh oh
Desparate thoughts, your hope calls you a liar
Fear begins to revel
Nothing but your will sets you on fire
Fire lasts forever
Oh oh oh oh
Can't get any better
Oh oh oh oh
Dance under the ladder
If you dare, so what you're waiting for
You can see that whatever the weather
That the wind's always there, always fair
Oh oh oh oh
And it always has been now or never
The decision has got to be made
Oh oh oh
You can see that whatever the weather
That the wind's always there, always fair
Oh oh oh
And it always has been now or never
The decision has got to be made
You can see that whatever the weather
That the wind's always there, always fair
Oh oh oh oh
And it always has been now or never
The decision has got to be made
Oh oh oh

Ieva Zasimauskaitė – When We’re Old (Lithuania 2018)
I know I'll never forget
That day, the first time we met
We've come a long way since then
And I would do it all again
From your very first smile
I knew that I'd walk a mile
See, it's for real when you know
You never wanna let go
These are the reasons
I want you to know
You make this place feel like home
These are the reasons
I can't let you go, oh oh
Let's sing a song that we wrote
When we're old, ah ah
When we're old, ah ah
No matter what comes our way
I feel like I'm here to stay
You were the right from the start
And let me inside your heart
After all this time
I hate the sound of goodbye
And if you leave I would...
These are the reasons
I want you to know
You make this place feel like home
These are the reasons
I can't let you go, oh oh
Let's sing a song that we wrote
When we're old, ah ah
When we're old, ah ah
Right from our very first kiss
I knew it'll end up like this
I'm not afraid to grow old
If I have your hand to hold

Johnny Logan – Hold Me Now (Ireland 1987)
Don't...
Don't close your heart to how you feel...
Dream...
And don't be afraid the dream's not real...
Close your eyes,
pretend it's just the two of us again...
Make believe this moment's here to stay...
Touch...
Touch me the way you used to do...
I know...
Tonight could be all I have with you...
From now on you'll be with someone else
instead of me...
So tonight...let's build this memory...
For the last time...
Hold me now
Don't cry
Don't say a word just...
Hold me now...
And I...will know though we're apart
We'll always be together
Forever in love...
What do you say when words are not enough?
Time...
Time will be kind once we're apart
And your tears...
Tears will have no place in your heart
I wish I...
I could say how much I'll miss you when you're gone
All my love for you will go on and on and...
Hold me now
Don't cry
Don't say a word just...
Hold me now...
And try...to understand that...
I hope that last you'll find
What you've been searching for
Though I won't be there anymore...
I will always...love you...
Hold me now
Don't cry
Don't say a word just...
Hold me now...
And I...will know though we're apart
We'll always be together
Forever inlove
What do you say when words are not enough?
What can I say now my words are not enough...?





Patricia Kaas – S’il fallait le faire (France 2009) (translation)
If it had to be done, I would stop the earth
I would turn off the light so that you stay asleep
If it had to be done to please you, raising opposite winds
In a desert without life, I would find the sea
And if it had to be done, I would stop the rain
It will turn around the rest of our lives
If it had to be done to please you, listening to you every night
When you speak of love, I would speak of it too
So you still look into the depth of my eyes
So you still see in there the biggest of the big fires
And so your hand clings to my skin where it wants to
If you fly away one day, I would follow if I could
And if it had to be done, I would repel the winter
With hard blows of springtime and long clear mornings
If it had to be done to please you, I would stop the time
So all your words of yesterday stay with me now
So I still look into the blue of your eyes
So your two hands still get lost in my hair
I will make everything bigger and if it’s too much or too little
I would be wrong all the time, if that’s what you want
I do want to give everything, if only you believe in it
My heart does want to bleed, if only you see it
Until being nothing more but the shadow of your nights
Until being nothing more but a shadow that follows you
And if it had to be done


Koit Toome & Laura – Verona (Estonia 2017)
Sleeping all alone
You wake up with a bottle in your hands
No sound of serenade cause we both know we lost our game
I was always high on loving you
Before the romance turned to drama
Like Romeo and Juliet once before
We are lost in Verona

Learning through the scars
Will make you stronger time is the proof
I'm not a loner kind
I know I just can't get over you

I was always trying to tell the truth
Before the romance turned to drama
I hope the best in me was always you
Before we lost our Verona

We are lost
Lost in the crowd of the street
We are lost
Like two sailing boats in the sea
We are lost
Cause sometimes we building and burning down love
We are lost our Verona

Ooooooooooooo
We lost and we found our Verona
Ooooooooooooo
We are lost in Verona

Reckless type of love, reckless type of love
We never said I'm sorry
We never said enough
This western type of woman; western type of man
Disappeared in Verona

Ooooooooooooo
We lost and we found our Verona
Ooooooooooooo
We are lost in Verona

We are lost
Lost in the crowd of the street
We are lost
Like two sailing boats in the sea
We are lost
Cause sometimes we building and burning down love
We are lost our Verona

Ooooooooooooo
We lost and we found our Verona
Ooooooooooooo
We are lost in Verona



Amir – J’ai cherché (France 2016)
I’ve looked for a meaning to my existence
It made me leave my innocence behind
I’ve finished with an unprotected heart
I’ve looked for love and recognition
I’ve paid the price of silence
I am getting hurt and I start over again
You gave me the will to be myself
Gave a meaning to my questions
You’ve killed the fear that was sleeping here
That was sleeping here in my arms
You
You’re the one that’s making me strong
I’ll be looking, looking for you
Like the melody of my song
You
You’re the one that’s making me strong
I’ll be looking, looking for you
Like the melody of my song
I’ve looked for a direction, a landmark
Split into two hemispheres
Like a mistake of the universe
I’ve thrown too many bottles into the sea
I drank so much bitter liqueur
It made my lips as cold as stone
You
You’re the one that’s making me strong
I’ll be looking, looking for you
Like the melody of my song
You
You’re the one that’s making me strong
I’ll be looking, looking for you
Like the melody of my song
Along with our wounds
And our flippancies
It’s when we completely lose our faith
That we find a lost paradise inside ourselves
Oh, you, you, you, you
You
You’re the one that’s making me strong
I’ll be looking, looking for you
Like the melody of my song
Like the melody of my song
You
You’re the one that’s making me strong
I’ll be looking, looking, looking for you
Like the melody of my song
Like the melody of my song
You
You’re the one that’s making me strong
I’ll be looking, looking, looking for you
Giving you love with my song
Giving you love with my song
You

Vânia Fernandes – Senhora do mar (Negras águas) (Portugal 2008) (translation)
Lady of the sea
Before you, I kneel
Who comes and takes, half of life and peace
From this table, from this house, now its lost
Love, what’s happened with you?
Before you, my soul is empty
Who comes and takes what is mine?
Oh high sea, bring me
My endless love
Ah, black waters, waves of sorrow
They froze the fire in my eyes (Lady of the sea)
He’s not sailing anymore (He’s not sailing anymore)
And nobody sees you crying
Lady of the sea
Who comes and takes, half of life and peace
From this table, from this house, now its lost
Love, what’s happened with you?
Ah, black waters, waves of sorrow
They froze the fire in my eyes (Lady of the sea)
Salty wounds, prayers in vain (Praying in vain)
Let his heart (Let his heart)
Beat next to me (Beat next to me)
Ah, black waters, waves of sorrow
They froze the fire in my eyes (Lady of the sea)
He’s not sailing anymore (He’s not sailing anymore)
And nobody sees you crying (And nobody sees you crying)
Lady of the sea (Lady of the sea)



Sabina Babayeva – When the Music Dies (Azerbaijan 2012)
You, you are my best friend
You are my everything, so don’t leave me now
You, you are the best of me
The reason that I believe, so don’t leave me now
And I try to keep us alive
But you’re cold, cold, cold
Now every second that my heart skips, it ends
But I still wanna keep us alive
But it’s cold, cold, cold, cold when the music dies
It’s all black and white and there’s no sunrise
When the music dies
No you, you can’t even look at me
Still not gonna speak to me
Whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah
And I try to keep us alive
But you’re cold, cold, cold
Now every second that my heart skips, it ends
But I try to keep us alive
But it’s cold, cold, cold, cold
When the music dies (cold, cold, cold)
It gets cold and there’s no sunrise (cold, cold, cold)
So cold, now every second that my heart skips, it ends
Oh… try to keep us alive
But you’re cold, cold, so cold
Every second my heartbeat ends
Still I try to keep us alive
But you’re cold, cold, cold
When the music dies

Mocedades – Eres tú (Spain 1973) (translation)

You're just like a promise, only you, only you.
Just like a precious summer morning.
Your smile is so honest, only you, only you.
So perfect, only you.

You gave me some hope back, only you, only you.
Just like the raindrops on my shoulders.
A breath of fresh air that's, only you, only you.
So perfect, only you.

(Only you - like the water in my fountain)
(Only you - like the flame of all my fire)
(Only you)
It's the thing that you do
(Like a flame that burns forever)
You're just like a flame that burns forever
(Only you)
It's that thing that you do
(The flour of all my bread)
My life, it's only you

You're just like a poem, only you, only you.
A gentle guitar that sings at nighttime,
And on the horizon, only you, only you.
So perfect, only you.

(Only you)
It's the thing that you do
(Like a flame that burns forever)
You're just like a flame that burns forever
(Only you)
It's that thing that you do
(The flour of all my bread)
My life, it's only you

(Only you)
It's that thing that you do
(Like the water in my fountain)
You're just like the water in my fountain
(Only you - you're the flame of all my fire)

Ott Lepland – Kuula (Estonia 2012) (translation)

Listen to what the horizon says
Listen to how far it goes
Listen to what the wind has yet to say
Listen…now.

Look, when darkness is on the way
Wait, there still remains light
Listen to how your land breathes
Listen…now.

Listen to what remained in the silence
Listen to these simple moments only
Listen, the heart has a voice too.

Listen to the voice of your rainbow
Look and you will soon see
Listen to this song to the living
Listen…only

Listen to what remained in the silence
Listen to these simple moments only
Listen, the heart has a voice too.

The road has passed into shadows
I am still looking and searching
It is the power of silence – the sound
I am waiting for you here, halfway
Listen to the call of my voice.

Listen to what remained in the silence
Listen to these simple moments only
Listen to the voice of my heart (or: listen, my heart has a voice)

Listen to what the horizon says
Listen to how far it goes
Listen to what the wind has yet to say
Listen…now

Mikolas Josef – Lie To Me (Czech Republic 2018)

Oh oh she a good girl at home but
her skirt goes up like Marilyn Monroe's
Papa likes the drama mama hotter then lava
She rocking high heels Prada her face like Madonna
By the way she moved got me making a puddle
Baby I already knew you would be nothing but a trouble
Damn it everybody knows she never loved for real
Honey bunny up all night wannabe couplegoals queen
I know you 'bop-whop-a-lu bop' on his wood bamboo when
you were still seeing me and well he didn't even knew hmmm...
But God damn it come and count to three now sit down GGY I'm on fire
Come and lie to me
Lie to me oh baby come a little closer
Lie to m
Lie to me oh baby lean upon my shoulder
Lie to me
Get down on my body and love me like it was always meant to be
Now you love somebody new I always knew
So come and give it to me
When the beat dropped she dropped
Dropped it like its hot and now without a
second thought she got me doing what I'm not
Then it got heavy
Mom I'm feeling home already but steady
Plenty motherfuckers wanna eat my spaghetti
Then she got one of my friends
She got him dripping on wood
I know it hurt so bad but it feels so good
Quit sweet talking me now baby I don't give a fu*k you
should have thought about me before you fu*ked him at the club
I know you 'bop-whop-a-lu bop' on his wood bamboo when
you were still seeing me and well he didn't even knew hmmm...
But God damn it come and count to three now sit down GGY I'm on fire
Come and lie to me
Lie to me oh baby come a little closer
Lie to m
Lie to me oh baby lean upon my shoulder
Lie to me
Get down on my body and love me like it was always meant to be
Now you love somebody new I always knew
So come and give it to me
You know I like it
When you lie lie lie
You look so good
When you lie lie lie
Set my camel in the mood... when you lie
Come and lie to me
Lie to me oh baby come a little closer
Lie to me
Lie to me oh baby lean upon my shoulder
Lie to me
Get down on my body and love me like it was always meant to be
Now you love somebody new I always knew
So come and give it to me





AySel & Arash – Always (Azerbaijan 2009)

Always on my mind
Always in my heart
I've been waiting for you night after night
Like a shadow staying close to the light
Suddenly you stand beside me
And I see a million burning stars
You are always on my mind
Always in my heart
And I can hear you call my name
On a mountain high
Always on my mind
Always in my dreams
I wanna hold you close with me
Always all the time
I believe I'm addicted to you
In your eyes I see dreams coming true
Finally I have found you
And now I will never let you go no
You are always on my mind
Always in my heart
And I can hear you call my name
On a mountain high
Always on my mind
Always in my dreams
I wanna hold you close with me
Always all the time
Always on my mind
Always in my heart
And I can hear you call my name
On a mountain high
Always on my mind always in my dreams
I wanna hold you close with me
Always all the time
Always on my mind
Always in my heart
And I can hear you call my name
On a mountain high
Always on my mind always in my dreams
I wanna hold you close with me
Always all the time
Always on my mind
Always in my heart
Always on my mind
Always in my dreams
Always all the time

Zlata Ognevich – Gravity (Ukraine 2013)

Nothing comes from dreams but dreams
Still you believe in wonder
Something happens and it seems
Like a strike of thunder
Nothing comes from love but love
Why is it growing stronger?
I am falling from above
I will wait no longer
I’m like a butterfly
Spinning round a sword as if to dare
I should have stayed up high
(It’s stronger than me) My gravity, my gravity
Hey… sha…
Ah yeah… lele…
See… lele…
Nothing comes from pride but pride
Mmh… my way is clear
Dancing on the edge tonight
Now I feel no fear
I’m like a butterfly
Spinning round a sword as if to dare
I should have stayed up high
(It’s stronger than me) My gravity, my gravity
I’m like a butterfly (My gravity)
I’m like a butterfly
And I should have stayed up high
(It’s stronger than me) My gravity, my gravity
Gravity

Ruth Lorenzo – Dancing in the Rain (Spain 2014)
We're dancing in the rain
Dancing in the rain
Life, gets you every time
Open up,
You never know what you will find
You never know what waits inside
So, live
Like you'll never stop
Take this chance
And give it everything you've got
Come on and let the rhythm drop
We're dancing in the rain
Dancing in the rain
Keep on like it's never ending
Keep on till the light of day
Keep on dancing in the rain
The rain, the rain
The Rain, the rain
Dancing
Dancing
Dancing

Danijela – Neka mi ne svane (Croatia 1998)

Another day has passed by
Once more, the moon has come
Silently, like a dear guest
To abridge my mornings

For the sorrow leads me through the years
Steals the dream, till a new day dawns

May the dawn never rise
May I disappear, may I cease to exist
May I not wake up without you
May the dawn never rise
May I disappear, may I cease to exist
May I not wake up without you

Another day has passed by
Once more, the moon has come
Silently, like a dear guest
To abridge my mornings

For the sorrow leads me through the years
Steals the dream, till a new day dawns

May the dawn never rise
May I disappear, may I cease to exist
May I not wake up without you
May the dawn never rise
May I disappear, may I cease to exist
May I not wake up without you

May I not wake up without you
May the dawn never rise
May I disappear, may I cease to exist
May I not wake up without you
May I not wake up without you

Dana International – Diva (Israel 1998)

She is all you’ll ever dream to find
On her stage she sings her story
Pain and hurt will steal her hearts alight
Like a queen in all her glory

And when she cries, Diva is an angel
When she laughs, she’s a devil
She is all beauty and love

Viva nari’a, viva Victoria, Aphrodita
Viva la Diva, viva Victoria, Cleopatra

Silent tears drop from these eyes tonight
Tears of prayer for all those aching hearts

And when she cries, Diva is an angel
When she laughs, she’s a devil
She is all beauty and love

Viva nari’a, viva Victoria, Aphrodita
Viva la Diva, viva Victoria, Cleopatra
Viva nari’a, viva Victoria, Aphrodita
Viva la Diva, viva Victoria, Cleopatra

Diva, Diva, Diva, Diva

Viva nari’a, viva Victoria, Aphrodita
Viva la Diva, viva Victoria, Cleopatra
Viva nari’a, viva Victoria, Aphrodita



Marco Mengoni – L’essenziale (Italy 2013)

Heroes support themselves:
"If a game is hard, you have to play!"
They were lucky to change offenses for good.

It happens also to us —
We make the war and then achieve peace.
And in my silence I cancel every your pain
To appreciate what I didn't manage to choose.

While the world is falling apart,
I am creating new spaces
And desires which belong also to you
Because you are always the most important to me.

I won't accept one more mistake in valuation.
Love is able to hide behind kind words
Which I said before
And which were empty and silly.

While the world is falling apart,
I am creating new spaces
And desires which belong also to you.

While the world is falling apart,
I am keeping away from the excesses and bad habits,
I will come back to the beginning, I am coming back to you
Because you are the most important to me.
Love doesn't follow the logic,
Captures your spirit and thirst.

While the world is falling apart,
I am creating new spaces
And desires which belong also to you.

While the world is falling apart,
I am keeping away from the excesses and bad habits,
I will come back to the beginning, I am coming back to you
Because you are the most important to me...





Ivi Adamou – La La Love (Cyprus 2012)

Lala lalalalalala lalalalala love
Lala lalalalalala lalalalala love
Love the way you fill me up with life
Baby we can break the speed of light
Nothing to fear when you are near
Just gimme more.
Reaching for the sky, I'm aiming high
Close my eyes and then it's almost like you fly
Up in the air, let's take it there
Never let go.
Oh oh oh, I feel the energy between you and me, baby it's so right
Oh oh oh, I feel the energy just taking over me, over me.
How I've been waiting for this
Lala lalalalalala lalalalala love
Oh I've been waiting for this
Lala lalalalalala lalalalala love
From Paris to LA over the night
All around the world just you and I
Nothing to fear, when you are near
We're on a roll
And we do it again, no stop no end
Out of control
Oh oh oh, I feel the energy between you and me, baby it's so right
Oh oh oh, I feel the energy just taking over me, over me
How I've been waiting for this
Lala lalalalalala lalalalala love
Oh I've been waiting for this
Lala lalalalalala lalalalala love
Nothing to fear, when you are near
Oh oh oh, I feel the energy between you and me, baby it's so right
Oh oh oh, I feel the energy just taking over me, over me.
How I've been waiting for this
Lala lalalalalala lalalalala love
Lala lalalalalala lalalalala love.
Oh, I've been waiting for this
Lala lalalalalala lalalalala love.





Gina G – Ooh Aah… Just a Little Bit (United Kingdom 1996)

You're my love, you're my sweetest thing
Don't shy away, don't shy away
Every night makes me hate the days
Can't get enough of your love

Am I wrong am I so unkind
Show me the way don't turn away
I can't hide all these thoughts in my mind
Every moment I'm just thinking of you

(Ooh Aah) Just a little bit
(Ooh Aah) A little bit more
(Ooh Aah) Just a little bit
You know what I'm looking for
(Ooh Aah) Just a little bit
(Ooh Aah) A little bit more
(Ooh Aah) Just a little bit
I'll give you love you can't ignore

Feeling good let's go all the way
It's got to be set me free
But tonight let my body say
Take it slow, don't let it go

How can I prove my love to you
Baby please, you're all I need
Like a child but it's born out of phase
Could act the angel but it wouldn't be true

What can you do for me
Oh what can you do
Cos I feel, so alive
I feel your love inside ohhhh

Just a little bit, little bit more
Just a little bit, just a little
Just a little bit, little bit more
Just a little bit, woah



Michael Schulte – You Let Me Walk Alone (Germany 2018)

I'm a dreamer, a make believer
I was told that you were too
I love the silence and the clear horizon
And I got that all from you

Every now and then I'm drawn to places
Where I hear your voice or see your face and
Every little thought will lead me right back to you

I was born from one love of two hearts
We were three kids and a loving mom
You made this place a home
A shelter from the storm
You said I had one life and a true heart
I tried my best and I came so far
But you will never know
Cause you let me walk this road alone


My childhood hero will always be you
And no one else comes close
I thought you'd lead me when life's misleading
That's when I miss you most

Every now and then I'm drawn to places
Where I hear your voice or see your face and
Every little thought will lead me right back to you

I was born from one love of two hearts
We were three kids and a loving mom
You made this place a home
A shelter from the storm
You said I had one life and a true heart
I tried my best and I came so far
But you will never know
Cause you let me walk this road alone

I was born from one love of two hearts
We were three kids and a loving mom
You made this place a home
A shelter from the storm
You said I had one life and a true heart
I tried my best and I came so far
But you will never know
Cause you let me walk this road alone

Anouk – Birds (The Netherlands 2013)
Isolated from the outside
Clouds have taken all the light
I have no control
It seems my thoughts wander off
Of the time when I tried to
Live life without you

Birds falling down the rooftops
Out of the sky like raindrops
No air, no pride

If being myself is what I do wrong
Then I would rather not be right
Hope's turned into fear
With my one wing I can't fly
With sunrise embrace my
Dreams tight and that's why

Birds falling down the rooftops
Out of the sky like raindrops
No air, no pride
Birds

To a place without fear, with no moonlight
All I need are trees and flowers and some sunlight
When memories are being made and where the old one dies
Where love ain't lost

Birds falling down the rooftops
Out of the sky like raindrops
Birds falling down the rooftops
Out of the sky like raindrops
No air, no pride
That's why
Birds don't fly

Saara Aalto – Monsters (Finland 2018)
Closed my eyes, so I couldn't see it
Felt so numb, but now I'm ready to feel it
So tonight I'm making friends
With all the creatures that are hiding there under my bed

I ain't gonna hold on to these monsters anymore
Now I'm gonna let in all the light, tear down the walls
At my worst I found my army strong
All the demons are gone
You can try and scare me now, but I ain't scared no more
I ain't scared no more
(I ain't, I ain't, I ain't scared no more)

It's my life, I'm ready to lead it
I'm gonna roll the dice, you better believe it

So tonight I'm making friends
With all the creatures that are hiding there under my bed

I ain't gonna hold on to these monsters anymore
Now I'm gonna let in all the light, tear down the walls
At my worst I found my army strong
All the demons are gone
You can try and scare me now, but I ain't scared no more
(I ain't, I ain't, I ain't scared no more)

I ain't scared no more
No, no, I ain't scared, I ain't scared

I ain't gonna hold on to these monsters anymore
Now I'm gonna let in all the light, tear down the walls
At my worst I found my army strong
All the demons are gone
You can try and scare me now, but I ain't scared no more
(I ain't, I ain't, I ain't scared no more)
I ain't scared no more

Mor ve Ötesi – Deli (Turkey 2008)
The holder of my soul is being sought.
Have I come to the exact place?
Resists the offender of passion
as indignant and belittled.

The holder of my soul is being sought.
Did I come to the exact place?
It resists, resists , resists..

Bring me up, don’t make me cry..
Where is your love you are proud of?
Bring me up, don’t make me cry..
Don’t keep me busy in vain with your fake daydreams..

One half of me is sane, one half is insane
Four parts of me are sane , one part is insane
Everyone is sane, I am the (only) one insane
I am the one insane, I am the one insane

Bring me up, don’t make me cry..
Where is your love you are proud of?
Bring me up, don’t make me cry..
Don’t keep me busy in vain with your fake daydreams..
Francesca Michielin – No Degree of Separation (Italy 2016)

It's the first time it happened to me
In the past I locked myself in a box
Always a bit distant from the things of life
Because I never felt them too deeply
Then I felt an emotion lighting fast
And making itself a path in my chest without putting off its voice
And I don't feel tension any more, only life, inside me

No degree of separation
No type of hesitation
There isn't any division between us any longer
We're a single direction in this world that moves

There's no degree of separation
I gave less space to the heart and more to reason
Always a step back and with my soul on alert
And I watched the world from a door
That was never completely open
And from afar
And no, there's no hesitation, finally, inside me

There is no degree of separation
There is no degree of hesitation
There is no degree of space between us
Live in love
We are stars aligned together
Dancing through the sky,
We are shining...

(No degree of separation)
No degree of separation
In this world that moves...

Then I felt an emotion lighting fast
And making itself a path in my chest without putting off its voice







Moje 3 – Ljubav je svuda (Serbia 2013)
Love, love doesn’t exist they say
They lie, don’t be afraid, when he is there
With him love is for the whole life and even after
You will see that!

I’m going to ask you in a year and so
When he cheats on you
then your heart will be just fish food
You know that

I’m feeling crazy
I want to believe, and then I don’t,
because I don’t know everything
that love is everywhere
And then I am loving, and then I am not
I will try everything with him
and maybe something else

Dream your dream world in colour blue
dream because that man is Yours

Do not listen to his lies, no more!
When He kisses you, tell him to go away

I’m feeling crazy
I want to believe, and then I don’t,
because I don’t know everything
that love is everywhere
And then I am loving, and then I am not
I will try everything with him
and maybe something else

You’ll be waiting for him every night until the morning
He will make you coffee in the morning, while you are still in bed
Believe me sister, I’m doing you a favour
LALALA…

I’m feeling crazy
love is everywhere
And then I am loving, and then I am not
I will try everything with him
and maybe something else.

Jalisse – Fiumi di parole (Italy 1997)
I'm waiting for a thousand excuses from you, as always
You're a river of words where I drown too
How great you are but this talking from a talk show
What does it have to do with us?

I'm trying the only remedy that I've been using for a while
I close my ears to the story that I've heard before
It's the way you are, by now I should limit myself
Saying Yes to you

Rivers of words
Rivers of words between us
Sometime they will take us away
I'll give you my heart
I'll give you my heart, If you want
If you can, speak to it now
Speak to it now

You're shouting in a way that I don't understand anymore
I'm losing your respect, saying goodbye would be better
Like in a movie, the classic movie
Where she will do something foolish

Rivers of words
Rivers of words between us
Sometime they will take us away
I'll give you my heart
I'll give you my heart, If you want
If you can, speak to it now

I'd like to hold a picture
Feeling how it's going inside me
A silence from you with more complicity
I'd like...

Rivers of words
Rivers of words between us
Sometime they will take us away
I'll give you my heart
I'll give you my heart, If you want
If you can, speak to it now

Rivers of words
Rivers of words between us
Sometime they will take us away
I'll give you my heart
I'll give you my heart, If you want
If you can, speak to it now
Speak to it now

(Rivers of words)
(Rivers of words between us)
I'll give you my heart
I'll give you my heart, If you want
If you can, speak to it now

Rivers of words

Céline Dion – Ne partez pas sans moi (Switzerland 1988)

You who seek the star
You who live a dream
You, heroes in the space
In the heart, bigger than the earth
Give me the chance
Take me far from here

Do not leave without me
Let me follow
You who fly to other cities
Let me live
The most beautiful adventure
The most beautiful journey
Which leads one day
To suns
To the planets of love

You the new poets
You the magic birds
You, you might find
New music
You, give me a chance
I want to sing along

Do not leave without me
Let me follow
You who fly to other cities
Let me live
Blue of infinity
The joy of being free
On rays, on suns

On songs, on wonders
And in sky of love
Blue of infinity
The joy of being free
You who seek these other lives
You who fly towards the year 2000
Do not leave without me

Joci Pápai – Origo (Hungary 2017)

You have to close your eyes,
so you can see me.
To conquer my heart,
you have to know my soul.

If you don't need me, let me go
I was born to be a loafer.
I have already suffered enough,
but God sees me.

Yaloma lomma, yaloma lomma
Yaloma lomma lomalom
Yaloma lomma, yaloma nedinna
Yaloma lomma, lomalom

Why did you lie to me
that the color of my skin doesn't matter?
You knew that my eyes are brown,
it never changes within me.

I don't need you in my life,
get out of here, leave me alone!
I don't want to see you,
be cursed forever.

Yaloma lomma, yaloma lomma
Yaloma lomma lomalom
Yaloma lomma, yaloma nedinna
Yaloma lomma, lomalom

God accosted/addressed me when I was four
He gave a real weapon in my hand.
I knew that he's the only one who can take care of me,
I was practicing more than a Samurai with him.
I can trust in him, he always tells the truth
I can cry with him but he shows the (right) way.
It's a kind of alliance that remains forever
it's not expendable, he's my most precious treasure.

Mysterious forces lived within the child
they were afraid of him, it appears in their eyes.
My strings are attacking, crying in the bodies
you can defend in vain, it's a poison in the instrument.
I drenched people with it (with the music)
you hear my melody, you already know my name.
This is a long road, sores are on my back
tears of thousands are flowing on my guitar.

Marie Myriam – L’oiseau et l’enfant (France 1977)

Like a child with light in the eyes
Who sees birds flying away
Like the blue bird flying over the earth
See how the world, the world is beautiful.

Beautiful boat with dance on vogues
Drunk of life, love and wind
Beautiful the song of coming vogues
Deserted with white sand

White the innocent, the blood of the poet
Who invented the love while singing
So that the life dress up party
And that the night turns into day

Day of a life where the dawn is rising
To wake up the city with heavy eyes
Where mornings flakes the dreams
To give us a world of love

Love is you, love is me
The bird is you, the child is me.

I am just a girl of shade
Who sees the shine the evening star
You my star who weaves my round
Come on my black sun

Black the misery, the humans and the war
Who thinks that they have the kidneys of time
Country of love do not have borders
For those who have a child heart

Like a child with light in the eyes
Who sees birds flying away
Like the blue bird flying over the earth
See how the world, the world is beautiful

Love is you, love is me
The bird is you, the child is me
The bird is you, the child is me.

Lena – Taken by a Stranger (Germany 2011)

She's got a knuckle in her eye
He knows her catcall
Can't escape from telling lies
I heard her sayin':

"Hey, mind if I take this chair?"
"Hey, mind if I take this chair?"

He drops a pause
She looks annoyed
But she's so mean
He thinks she has to be the one

Taken by a stranger
Stranger things are startin' to begin
Lured into the danger
Trip me up and spin me round again

You got some coffee on your collar
And you forgot to comb your hair
I can't wait till I do better
You're here and I don't care
Can't help it if you like it 'cause I won't be here tomorrow
No one ever told you that you wouldn't be rejected

Taken by a stranger
Stranger things are startin' to begin
Lured into the danger (Danger is a risky business)
Trip me up and spin me round again

Tatatara tara tara...
Ooh... la la la la...

Put the blindfold on his eyes
She saw him peek through
Can't imagine her disguise
I heard her saying:

"Hey, mind if I take this chair?"
Yeah, see if I care

Taken by a stranger
Stranger things are startin' to begin
Lured into the danger (Danger is a risky business)
Trip me up and spin me round again

Elhaida Dani – I’m Alive (Albania 2015)
Ay…
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

I was too afraid right from the start
To even let you, welcome you in my heart
You cut it deep and left it bleeding hard
Will I ever heal these painful scars?

I just can't help it
I'm out of breath, I’m trying to find the words to say
Time passed by
Now it's broad daylight.

I know you will come with the speed of light
You’re my everything, all that I need
You shut down my dreams, but I’m not gonna cry
You live within me, that’s why I am alive.

I am alive,
'Cause you are my life
You are my sun
I am alive,
'Cause you are my life.

Ay
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ay
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

You name is printed crystal clear on glass
From all the sighs coming out my breath
I'm blinded by this love,
Can't stop screaming out your name so loud
Where are you at?
Baby, won't you come back?

Baby, please come back...

I know you will come with the speed of light
You're my everything, all that I need
You shut down my dreams, but I'm not gonna cry
You live within me, that's why I am alive.

I am alive,
'Cause you are my life
You are my sun
I am alive,
'Cause you are my life.

I know you will come with the speed of light
You're my everything, you're all that I need
You shut down my dreams, but I'm not gonna cry
You live within me, that's why I'm alive.

I am alive,
'Cause you are my life
You are my sun
I am alive,
'Cause you are my life.

You are my life.

Eimear Quinn – The Voice (Ireland 1996)
I hear your voice on the wind
And I hear you call out my name

"Listen my child," You say to me,"I am the voice of your history
'Be not afraid come follow me. Answer my call and I'll set you free."

I am the voice in the wind and the pouring rain
I am the voice of your hunger and pain
I am the voice that always is calling you
I am the voice, I will remain

I am the voice in the fields when the summer's gone;
The dance of the leaves when the Autumn winds blow
Ne'er do I sleep throughout all the cold Winter long
I am the force that in Springtime will grow

I am the voice of the past that will always be;
Filled with my sorrows and blood in my fields
I am the voice of the future
Bring me your peace
Bring me your peace and my wounds they will heal

I am the voice in the wind and the pouring rain
I am the voice of your hunger and pain
I am the voice that always is calling you
I am the voice

I am the voice of the past that will always be
I am the voice of your hunger and pain
I am the voice of the future
I am the voice
I am the voice
I am the voice
I am the voice


Cesár Sampson – Nobody But You (Austria 2018)
Lord, I'm gonna get so high tonight
I'm gonna let the floodgates open wide
I'm in open water
This is what I need
And though I try to get you off my mind

And I get no sleep
I'm in too deep
I can't let you leave

It wouldn't be right letting you go running away from love
Ain't nobody but you I can hold onto
So am I wrong giving my all making you stay tonight?
Ain't nobody but you I can hold onto
(Ain't nobody, ain't nobody)

(Hey)Lord, I'm gonna bring you back tonight, girl
Oh, you're running circles round my mind
After your words have been my bible
How can I search for someone new?
When I really want you by my side

And I get no sleep
I'm in too deep
To let you leave

It wouldn't be right letting you go running away from love
Ain't nobody but you I can hold onto
(Ain't nobody, ain't nobody)
So am I wrong giving my all making you stay tonight?
Ain't nobody but you I can hold onto
(Ain't nobody, ain't nobody)

Don't make me tear my heart out
I'm shaking 'til I fall down
Don't make me tear my heart out
Don't make me tear my heart out
I'm shaking 'til I fall down
Don't make me tear my heart out

It wouldn't be right letting you go running away
Ain't nobody but you I can hold onto
So am I wrong giving my all making you stay tonight?
Ain't nobody but you I can hold onto
(Ain't nobody, ain't nobody)
It wouldn't be right letting you go running away from love
Ain't nobody but you I can hold onto
(Ain't nobody, ain't nobody)

Ain't nobody but you

Mia Martini – Rapsodia (Italy 1992)
One day the old lovers
Meet in a bar
Deceitful but sincere telling how it goes
It was raining outside and they were there
Thinking about who knows where
Who knows why it finished.

One day the old lovers tell each other their ages
Sweet resentments and other truth

Who are we, feeling lost?
So different from the heroes in our movie
With the irony and a bit of trouble
In this immense rhapsody, now about us

But one day the old lovers long for more
Dreams and desires of another youth
And they leave their families, betray their friends
They don't want advice about how to be happy

And when the old lovers leave each other at the bar
They will become songs of a time far behind

Who are we, sitting here?
Listening to a story of a life that didn't work out
Who are we, sunk in shame
For this immense and hopeless rhapsody

Oh who are we, sunk in shame
For this immense and hopeless rhapsody





Kaliopi – Crno i belo (FYR Macedonia 2012)

Look me in the eyes now
I'm not a loser, know
I won't give up untill the end
There's no rise without a fall

Open up your soul, confess to me
What are we now, you and me
The half of me, in you
And the rest of you sleeps within me
C'mon now hug me, lift me up to the heaven

Everything's black and white
One thruth and one lie
Although we're together
I choose happiness, you choose sorrow

Everything's black and white
Good and bad, nothing separates them
C'mon now, smile
The day's leading me in white nights

Look me in the eyes now
There you'll find it all
C'mon give it all up
For new birth, with me

Open up your soul, confess to me
What are we now, you and me
The half of me, in you
And the rest of you sleeps within me
C'mon now hug me, lift me up to the heaven

Everything's black and white
One thruth and one lie
Although we're together
I choose happiness, you choose sorrow

Everything's black and white
Good and bad, nothing sepparates them
C'mon now, smile
The day's leading me in white nights

Everything's black and white
One thruth and one lie
Although we're together
I choose happiness, you choose sorrow

Everything's black and white
Good and bad, nothing sepparates them
C'mon now, smile
The day's leading me in white nights

Everything's black and white

Knez – Adio (Montenegro 2015)
The sky brought you to me,
The sky took you from me,
Still hurts me what used to hurt.
My days are the walls
My nights are the shackles (bonds)
I’m still serving you, my love.

I still don’t give you to the mists of the mountains,
I still don’t give you to the depths of the water.
And you ask me to let you go, forever
To sink you into oblivion and say goodbay.

Rosemary has blossomed, white lily has bent,
Everything smells like sorrow.
I try to forget, not to think of you,
But my heart is still pining for you.

I still don’t give you to the mists of the mountains,
I still don’t give you to the depths of the water.
And you ask me to let you go, forever
To sink you into oblivion and say goodbye.

A,a,a....

I still don’t give you to the mists of the mountains,
I still don’t give you to the depths of the water.
And you ask me to let you go, forever
To sink you into oblivion and say goodbye.






Niamh Kavanagh – In Your Eyes (Ireland 1993)
Showing no emotion, my feelings locked inside
I made myself an island, trying to take my heart and hide
I built a wall around me, afraid of letting go
But suddenly an open door I never saw before

In your eyes (Your eyes)
I see the light leading me home again
It’s heaven in your arms, my love
My heart is in your hands (Heaven in your arms)

In your eyes (Your eyes)
Seems so right, I see forever in your smile
This woman is a child again (In your eyes)

Love’s been building bridges between your heart and mine
I’m safe here on my island, but I’m out on the edge this time
I built a wall around me, thought I’d save myself the pain
Your touch swept me away, now I’ll never play it safe again

In your eyes (Your eyes)
I see the light leading me home again
It’s heaven in your arms, my love
My heart is in your hands (Heaven in your arms)

In your eyes (Your eyes)
Seems so right, I see forever in your smile
This woman is a child again

I’ve never been this close
How do I know love will survive?
I’m walking a tightrope
Here, in your arms, I’m alive

I’m in your eyes (Your eyes)
I see the light, I see forever in your smile
This woman is a child again

I’m in your eyes (In your eyes)
(I see the light leading me home again)
I see the light, I see the light
(It’s heaven in your arms, my love)
(My heart is in your hands) Whoa…

(In your eyes, feels so right)
I see forever in your smile
This woman is a child again
When I look in your eyes

Norma John – Blackbird (Finland 2017)
Blackbird, blackbird, don't sing to me
Don't sing below my window
Fly somewhere else, don't bother me
Don't sing below my window

You sang when he was in my bed
You sang when my heart sang
Now you remind me of something I'll never have
So blackbird, don't sing
Blackbird, don't sing

Blackbird, blackbird, I am now alone
Somewhere else go make your home
Don't nestle here, go find lovers of your own
I am now alone

You sang when he was in my bed
You sang when my heart sang
Now you remind me of something I'll never have
So blackbird, don't sing
Blackbird, don't sing

You sang when he was in my bed
You sang when my heart sang
Now you remind me of something I'll never have
So blackbird, don't sing
Blackbird, don't sing
Blackbird, don't sing

Sirusho – Qélé, qélé (Armenia 2008)

Let’s go, let’s go
From my Armenian soil
I came to bring
The wind of the mountains
The light of the sun
You wanna be with me
You think and dream of me
Come, let’s go, let’s go
Instead of watching me
You should be reaching me
Come, let’s go, move, let’s go
(Let’s, let’s, let’s, let’s go)
Let’s go, let’s go
Let’s go, let’s go
Let’s go, let’s go
Let’s go…
Time is reaching height
You should make it right
To end our fight
Just hold me tight
Hold me tight, let’s go
You wanna be with me
You think and dream of me
Come, let’s go, move, let’s go
Instead of watching me
You should be reaching me
Come, let’s go, move, let’s go
(Let’s, let’s, let’s, let’s go)
Let’s go, let’s go
Let’s go, let’s go
Let’s go, let’s go
Let’s go…
Time is reaching height
You should make it right
To end our fight
Just hold me tight
Let’s go…
Let’s go…
(Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go…)
Let’s go, let’s go
Let’s go, let’s go
Let’s go, let’s go
Let’s go…
Time is reaching height
You should make it right
To end our fight
Just hold me tight
(Let’s, let’s, let’s, let’s go)

Cláudia Pascoal – O jardim (Portugal 2018)

I never wanted you
Less than everything
Always, my love

If from heaven you are happy too
Take me, I take care
Always, around you

[Chorus]
The flowers are my place
Now that you're not here
I water your garden

The flowers are my place
Now that you're not here
I water your garden

[Verse 2]
I already promised
That someday I’ll change
Or try, to be greater

If from heaven you are happy too
Take me, I swear
Always, for your worth

[Chorus]
The flowers are my place
Now that you're not here
I water your garden

The flowers are my place
Now that you're not here
I water your garden

[Outro]
Now that you're not here, I water your garden
Now that you're not here, I water your garden
Now that you're not here
Now that you're not here, I water your garden

Harel Skaat – Milim (Israel 2010)
i can feel again
how it all began
but this is the end
i feel tonight
i closed my eye
a silent cry
to see you in the dim
the dim of light

with my fears
these bloody tears
our burning me inside
but i will sing you one more song
at least, i know that i have tried.

you left me only words,
and in these words i hide
a story that is heard
without you by my side
you left me only words
till they fade away
how i pray to have those words today

this empty room
the feel of gloom
just take it all-
it's all for you
our battle ends
at break of dawn
but what is left for me
when you are gone?

you left me only words,
and in these words i hide
a story that is heard
without you by my side
you left me only words
till they fade away
how i pray to have those words today

you left me only words
and in these words i hide
empty room of stories
without you by my side
you left me only words
till they fade away
how i pray to have those words today

and i get cold as ice
when i'm reminded
of where you are tonight
gleaming in his light
i need you even though
all these words that you left me
are now for him to know

you left me only words,
and in these words i hide
a story that is heard
without you by my side
you left me only words
till they fade away
how i pray to have those words today

you left me only words
till they fade away
how i pray
to have those words today

Kristina – Horehronie (Slovenia 2010)

When the sun goes down in Horehronie
I want to sing, die and live
When the sun goes down in Horehronie
I wish I could get closer to the sky

I'm lying on the grass and dreaming
Of what, I don't even know
In the breeze that gently sways me
When the sun is at its lowest point

The most beautiful trees are in Horehronie
A silent brotherhood is telling that
I come back here when I feel sad
The trees are saying: shake it off

I'm lying on the grass and dreaming
Of what, I don't even know
In the breeze that gently sways me
When the sun is at its lowest point

Ah... hallelujah...

When the sun goes down in Horehronie
Out there somewhere far away our bell is ringing
When it hurts, let it hurt
One day it will vanish in the black mountain

I'm lying on the grass and dreaming
My eyes are crying softly
In the breeze that gently sways me
When the sun is at its lowest point

Ah... ah... ah... ah...

I'm lying on the grass and dreaming
My eyes are crying softly
In the breeze that gently sways me
When the sun is at its lowest point

The most beautiful trees are in Horehronie

Amina – Le dernier qui a parlé (France 1991)

It's the last one that spoke that is right
In your house
It's the one that gave me a name that's right
Anyway
Girl or boy, all these proverbs are lessons
Don't say no
The world is neither bad nor good, there's something wrong with you
It's unreasonable

Houah houah... houah houah...
Hiah hiah... hiah hiah hiah...
Houah... hiah...

Tell me in the name of which nation do you raise the tone of your voice
In my house
Don't moan like a violin without partition
It's a lesson
The truth hides the front like silence
Who said long
It's the most strong that spoke that is right
Anyway

Houah houah... houah houah...
Hiah hiah... hiah hiah hiah...
Houah... hiah...

It's the last one that spoke and is right
In your house
It's the last that spoke and is right
In your house

All seasons do and undo the passions
What a derision
It's the last one that spoke and is right
Without condition
In this way or in that way
Here or over there

Houah houah... houah houah...
Hiah hiah... hiah hiah hiah...
Houah... hiah...

Hiah hiah... hiah hiah hiah...
Houah...

Yianna Terzi – Oneiro mou (Greece 2018)

If you look into my depths
You'll bring my dream to life
And if you look into my heart
I'll take you into my arms

How can I make it clear
that I’d die for you?
I'd give my life for you
(You’re) the end and the beginning, you’re everything

No matter my heartache
I wouldn't strike you off the map
I'd give my life for you
(You’re) the end and the beginning, you’re everything

Why would you want to change me
and dull my blue (colour)?
If you talk to my mountains,
my loneliness will be listening...

How can I make it clear
that I’d die for you?
I'd give my life for you
(You’re) the end and the beginning, you’re everything

No matter my heartache
I wouldn't strike you off the map
I'd give my life for you
(You’re) the end and the beginning, you’re everything

How can I make it clear
that I’d die for you?
I'd give my life for you
(You’re) the end and the beginning, you’re everything

How can I make it clear
that I’d die for you?
I'd give my life for you
(You’re) the end and the beginning, you’re everything

Ryan O’Shaughnessy – Together (Ireland 2018)

We were drifting like two icebergs out on the ocean
I was doing all I could to keep you close
There were troubles in the water
You swore it was nothing
You said that we would always stay afloat

Why would true love, look me in the eye and lie, lie?

I thought we'd be together 'til we die
I'll forever wonder why
I thought we'd be together 'til we die
I'll forever wonder why

Why have you been coming home so late in the evening?
Is there someone else that I should know about?
'Cause there's a smile on your face that I haven't seen
Since we started going out

How could true love, look me in the eye and lie, lie?

I thought we'd be together 'til we die
I'll forever wonder why
I thought we'd be together 'til we die
I'll forever wonder why
I'll forever wonder why

We said "Until death do us part"
And then you chose to break my heart
Remember right back to the start
When we said we'd be together 'til we die
I'll forever wonder why
I thought we'd be together 'til we die
I'll forever wonder why

You said we'd be together 'til we die
I'll forever wonder why
I thought we'd be together 'til we die
I'll forever wonder why
I'll forever wonder why

Domenico Modugno – Nel blu dipinto di blu (Italy 1958)

I think that dream like that
Will never return
I painted my hands
And face blu
Then all of sudden I was
Abducted by the wind
And I started to fly
In the infinite sky

To fly ho ho
To sing ho ho hoho
In the blu, painted blue
Happy to stay up there,
And I flew and flew
Happy, higher than the sun
And yet more up,
While the world
Slowly dissappered down below,
A sweet music playing
Just for me

To fly ho ho
To sing ho ho hoho
In the blu, painted blue
Happy to stay up there

But all dreams
Vanish at dawn because
When the moon sets,
It takes dreams with itself
But I keep dreaming
In your beautiful eyes,
That are blue as the sky
Spangled with stars

To fly, ho ho
To sing ho ho hoho,
In the blue of your blue eyes
Happy to be down here
And I keep flying, happy
Happy, higher than the sun
And yet more up,
While the world
Is slowly vanishing
In your blue eyes
Your voice is a soft music
That plays for me

To fly ho ho
To sing ho ho hoho
In the blue of your blue eyes
Happy to be down here
In the blue of your blue eyes
Happy to be down here
With you...


Eye Cue – Lost and Found (FYR Macedonia 2018)

Come and take me, I can show you how it's done
Come and take me when no one is around
Come and take me, I can show you how it's done
We'll be lost and we'll be

If you want me, I can tell you what it's all about
You're standing in the shadow, I'm wondering why
You're in the dark
I want a deeper, deeper love
I want you by my side
Just let me deeper, go deeper

Come and take me, I can show you how it's done
Come and take me when no one is around
Come and take me, I can show you how it's done
We'll be lost and we'll be found
We'll be lost and we'll be found, found

Have you ever thought about it?
We went too far, no there's no way back
No way back
Have you ever thought about it?
We went too far, no there's no way back
No way back

I wish you trust your intuition and let the journey start
You're afraid that you might suffer
But trust me what you'll find will blow your mind
I want a deeper, deeper love
I want you by my side
Just let me deeper, go deeper, go deeper

Come and take me, I can show you how it's done
Come and take me when no one is around
Come and take me, I can show you how it's done
We'll be lost and we'll be found
We'll be lost and we'll be
Baby, you and I we'll be lost and found

Have you ever thought about it?
We went too far, no there's no way back
No way back
Have you ever thought about it?
We went too far, no there's no way back
No way back

We'll be lost and we'll be

Edyta Górniak – To nie ja! (Poland 1994)

My world is so ordinary
Under tha black and white sky
People are cut out of grey pages
From the inside of books

The beautiful are from the background of romance
The tired are only from newspapers
And I... I am a white blank sheet of paper
Among you

It wasn't me who was Eve
It wasn't me who stole heaven
Though I have enough of tears
My tears, so many tears
I am made to be loved

It wasn't me who was Eve
I wasn't me who stole heaven
Don't ascribe more guilts to me
It's not me, it's not me
I am not...
... not Eve

The coldness blows from the sky
The hell bows with fire at your feet
And I... am a paper puppet, I must act

It wasn't me who was Eve
It wasn't me who stole heaven
Though I have enough of tears
My tears, so many tears
I am made to be loved, I know...

Before I turn into ash
I want to be a great flame
I want to ascend over the world
Far away up to the stars
To warm the sky with a dream

Carl Espen – Silent Storm (Norway 2014)
Head to toe
Flesh and bones?
Should feel whole
But the void
A silent storm?

I’m here to use my heart and my hands
Somehow the bruises changed my plans?

And there’s a silent storm inside me
Looking for a home
I hope that someone’s gonna find me
And say that I belong
I’ll wait forever and a lifetime
To find I’m not alone
There’s a silent storm inside me
And someday I’ll be calm
Someday I’ll be calm

Ask myself
What comes next
Will I fly??
Will I fall?
My silent storm?

I’m here to use my heart and my hands ?
Somehow the bruises changed my plans?

And there’s a silent storm inside me
Looking for a home
I hope that someone’s gonna find me
And say that I belong
I’ll wait forever and a lifetime
To find I’m not alone
And there’s a silent storm inside me
Someday I’ll be calm

And someday I’ll be calm
And someday I’ll be calm

Paul Harrington & Charlie McGettigan – Rock ‘n’ Roll Kids (Ireland 1994)

I remember '62
I was sixteen and so were you
And we lived next door,
On the avenue.
Jerry Lee was big and Elvis too;
Blue jeans and blue suede shoes,
And we never knew
What life held in store.
We just wanted to rock 'n' roll forever more.

We were the Rock 'n' Roll Kids
And Rock 'n' Roll was all we did
And listening to those songs on the radio;
I was yours and you were mine
But that was once upon a time,
Now we never seem to Rock 'n' Roll anymore.

Now Johnny's in love with the girl next door,
And Mary's down at the record store,
They don't want to be... Around us no more.
"Golden Oldies" but we hardly speak
Too busy running to a different beat
Hard to understand, we were once like them.
How I wish we could find those Rock 'n' Roll days again.

We were the Rock 'n' Roll Kids
And Rock 'n' Roll was all we did,
And listening to those songs on the radio;
I was yours and you were mine,
But that was once upon a time,
Now we never seem to Rock and Roll anymore.

I was yours and you were mine
That was once upon a time,
Now we never seem to Rock and Roll...

We just never seem to Rock and Roll anymore.


Aram MP3 – Not Alone (Armenia 2014)

You're all alone, you're all alone
No shoulder wants you to lean on
You thought this world was too cold
And you've made up
A whole new world

Don't cry, don't cry little bird
Though you are scared and you're hurt
You're gonna wake up
It's only a dream
And why do dreams make people scream?

You're not alone
You're not alone
You're not alone
You're not alone
You're not alone
You're not alone

What if it's all in one kiss
That turns all seeds into trees?
The strongest wind into breeze?
Enter all doors without keys
What if it's all in one kiss
That turns all seeds into trees?
The strongest wind into breeze?
What if it's all in one kiss?
You're not alone
You're not alone

Kalomira – Secret Combination (Greece 2008)
Can you see it?
Can you see it you have to discover me?
What goes wrong when I am crying
Or what I want when I'm smiling

Can you feel it?
Can you feel it that I'm not a little girl?
You're misunderstanding my way
And all the roles that I like to play

My secret combination – it's a mystery for you
Use your imagination, I'm not easy, but I'm true
My secret combination – boy, you have to try it hard
To win a destination in the centre of my heart

My secret combination – it's a mystery for you
Use your imagination, I'm not easy, but I'm true
My secret combination – boy, you have to try it hard
To win a destination in the centre of my heart

An open book
An open book, well, I'm sorry, I am not
Sometimes I'm acting like a lady
Sometimes woman, sometimes baby

My secret combination – it's a mystery for you
Use your imagination, I'm not easy, but I'm true
My secret combination – boy, you have to try it hard
To win a destination in the centre of my heart

My secret combination – it's a mystery for you
Use your imagination, I'm not easy, but I'm true
My secret combination – boy, you have to try it hard
To win a destination in the centre of my heart

My secret combination – it's a mystery for you
Use your imagination, I'm not easy, but I'm true
My secret combination – boy, you have to try it hard
To win a destination in the centre of my heart
To win a destination in the centre of my heart

Vicky Leandros – Après toi (Luxembourg 1972)
You go, in you
Love has for you
The smile of another
I would like but cannot want in you.
From now on,
You have my help
This is not your fault
But, however, you must know

That after you
I will not be able to live anymore, to live no more
That in remembering you
After you,
I will have wet eyes
The empty hands, the heart without joy.
With you,
I had learned how to laugh
And my laughter comes only by you.
After you, I will be only a shadow...
Of your shadow....
After you...

Even a day, if I make my life,
If I hold the promise
Who links two beings (perhaps) forever
After you
I might be able
To give my tenderness
But not my love

After you
I will not be able to live anymore, to live no more
That in remembering you
After you,
I will have wet eyes
The empty hands, the heart without joy.
With you,
I had learned how to laugh
And my laughter comes only by you.
After you, I will be only a shadow...
Of your shadow....
After you...

Sennek – A Matter of Time (Belgium 2018)
Sometimes it feels like it's meant to be broken
Sometimes we long for the unspoken
We try to avoid every commotion
By showing hardly any emotion
Sometimes it seems we're at the wrong station
Looking for a deadly combination
Sometimes it feels like imagination
Looking for all these cheap sensations

Why don't we go against the tide?
Against all their advice
We keep running, we keep on running
It's just a matter of time

Before it all echos, echos, and goes
Crashing against the walls
Hold my hand and keep your eyes closed
Before it all echos, echos, and goes
I suppose it's just a matter of time

Sometimes it feels like it's meant to be broken
Sometimes we act like we've already chosen
We try to retrieve something stolen
By remembering how it used to be golden

Why don't we go against the tide?
Against all their advice
We keep running, we keep on running
It's just a matter of time

Before it all echos, echos and goes
Crashing against the walls
Hold my hand and keep your eyes closed
Before it all echos, echos and falls
I suppose it's just a matter of time
Before it all echos, echos, and goes
Crashing against the walls
Hold my hand and keep your eyes closed
Before it all echos, echos, and goes
I suppose it's just a matter of time

Brainstorm – My Star (Latvia 2000)

My friends gonna call me: hey dreamer
The stars you are watching are so far
Tonight I know I will get there
By plane or by bus - right to my star
Pretend there are things you just don't know
In spite someone's told you are so cute
You have to ask and I will show
The snow in the summer or so, so

If my star will fall
Or disappeared at all

I will follow my star till the end of my days
And my heart's gonna lead me in so many ways
And if you gonna join me I'll be your guide
Baby, 'never say never', be my 'Runaway bride'

My friends gonna tell me: Just calm down
The clouds you are walking are so high
This is my chance, and I'll invite
All the dreamers and lovers to fly (fly)
I'm back from the future, life goes on
But still I remember my promise
You have to ask and I will show
The snow in the summer or so, so

If my star will fall
Or disappeared at all

I will follow my star till the end of my days
And my heart's gonna lead me in so many ways
And if you gonna join me I'll be your guide
Baby, 'never say never', be my 'Runaway bride'

Yeah.... My runaway bride, hey hey, hey yeah

If my star will fall
Or disappeared at all

I will follow my star till the end of my days
And my heart's gonna lead me in so many ways
And if you gonna join me I'll be your guide
Baby, 'never say never', be my 'Runaway bride'

Hey.. My runaway.. Iiihhh

Inga & Anush – Jan Jan (Armenia 2009)

Lucie Jones – Never Give Up on You (United Kingdom 2017)

Tell me your secrets, I'll keep them safe
No sign of weakness, it's a sign of faith
We'll stand tall so you don't fall

You're not defeated, you're in repair
Don't have to call me, I'll always be there
We'll stand tall, so you don't fall

If you could see how far you've walked
You would see that all's not lost

I will never give up on you
I don't care what I've got to lose
Just give me your hand and hold on
Together we'll dance through this storm
I will never give up on you
You're the one that I'm running to
Just give me your hand and hold on
Together we'll dance through this storm

Under the surface, I see you glow
I'm right beside you, you're never alone
Don't let go, when you're so close

If you could see how far you've walked
You would see that all's not lost

I will never give up on you
I don't care what I've got to lose
Just give me your hand and hold on
Together we'll dance through this storm
I will never give up on you
You're the one that I'm running to
Just give me your hand and hold on
Together we'll dancing through

This madness, we're running through
This magic, it's inside of you
It's madness, it's madness

Now you can see how far you've walked
The mountains climbed, the oceans crossed

I don't care what I've got to lose
Just give me your hand and hold on
Together we'll dance through this storm
I will never give up on you
You're the one that I'm running to
Just give me your hand and hold on
Together we'll dance through this storm

Gigliola Cinquetti – Non ho l’età (Italy 1964)

I am young,
I am young to love you.
I am young to go out only with you.

And it would be not necessary
It would be not necessary
To tell you anything
Because you know too much about me.

Let me live
With a romantic love
In waiting
That that day will come
But not now.

I am young,
I am young to love you.
I am young to go out only with you.

If you wanted,
If you wanted
To wait for me.
You will have that day,
All my love for you.

Let me live
With a romantic love
In waiting
That that day will come
But not now.

If you wanted,
If you wanted
To wait for me.
You will have that day,
All my love for you.

Charlotte Perrelli – Hero (Sweden 2008)

Everything has a beginning
Everything comes to an end
Take it or leave it
You better believe it
Be my lover, be my friend
Try to deny
What you're feeling
And you know
That your heart
Will say no
Love will last longer
Growing stronger
And stronger
If you stay
And don't let go
Oh, out on the line
Like a star, like a hero
Love will survive
Oh, taking the fight
Is the life of a hero
Staying alive
This is a story of love
And compassion
Only heroes can tell
Oh, out on the line
Like a star, like a hero
Love will survive
Heaven and earth
Keep colliding
But we love on a world
Of it's own
Oh, there you can fake it
Just make it or break it
Only you can find the one

Oh, out on the line
Like a star, like a hero
Love will survive
Oh, taking the fight
Is the life of a hero
Staying alive
This is a story of love
And compassion
Only heroes can tell
Oh, out on the line
Like a star, like a hero
Love will survive
Oh, survive
Heroes
Can live on their own
But heroes
Never die alone
Oh, out on the line
Like a star, like a hero
Love will survive
Oh, taking the fight
Is the life of a hero
Staying alive
This is a story of love
And compassion
Only heroes can tell
Oh, out on the line
Like a star, like a hero
Love will survive
Oh, out on the line
Like a star, like a hero
Love will survive

Softengine – Something Better (Finland 2014)
Even human bound, people rolling dice
Image on the ground, such a novel life, he thought
While knowing nothing at all

Every option noted or tendency made
They will carry on until the perfect date, she said
While knowing nothing at all

All the rules wide known, they mean nothing to me
Everything I’m used to seems to be
Fine, misshapen, made up fantasy
Should let go, should let go

But we found something better
Plain answer however
For I’ll not surrender
We found something better

Vis-à-vis, estranged, and we got close
Trust full of lies, sure how it goes, they told
While knowing nothing at all

Talking loud ’bout future in our hands
Exchanging dreams and how they’ll last, no no
Still knowing nothing at all

But we found something better
Plain answer however
For I’ll not surrender
We found something better

All these words reflected back to me
All these words I’m buying why?
All these words, the lives’ grand mystery
All these words a sweet white lie

All these words she meant to say to me
All these words against my faith
All these words before she passed away
All these words we’ll never, never, never change

We found something better
Plain answer however
For I’ll not surrender
We found something better

We found (Something better)
We found (Something better)
We found (Something better)
We found, we found, we found, we found, we found

Nadav Guedj – Golden Boy (Israel 2015)

Mama, someone broke my heart again
Tell her I don't think I can take it anymore
Mama, someone broke my heart again
Now I'm gonna ease my pain
Dancing on the floor

Take me out
I'm not in the mood for a broken heart
Gonna dance tonight, forget her
No, she doesn’t know
What I'm doing on the floor
Did you say hello, my ladies?

Pull me baby, I'm your trigger
You know that my love is bigger
Love, Love, Love
Let the rhythm take us higher
You know when I'm on fire
Check me out (3-2-1- hey!)

I'm a golden boy
Come here to enjoy
I'm the king of fun
Let me show you how we do it
I'm a golden boy
Come here to enjoy
And before I leave
Let me show you Tel Aviv

Hold me tight
We're not going home tonight
Oh yeah, do you like my dancing?
Pull me baby, I'm your trigger
You know that my love is bigger
Check me out (3-2-1- hey!)

I'm a golden boy
Come here to enjoy
I'm the king of fun
Let me show you how we do it
I'm a golden boy
Come here to enjoy
And before I leave
Let me show you Tel Aviv

This is how we do it
Aye, oh, this is how we do it

Mama, someone broke my heart again
Now I'm gonna ease my pain
Dancing on the floor

I'm a golden boy
Come here to enjoy
I'm the king of fun
Let me show you how we do it
I'm a golden boy
Come here to enjoy
And before I leave
Let me show you Tel Aviv
(Now dance, dance, dance, dance)

Ok, we gotta go
Three minutes
Bye bye

Sopho – Visionary Dream (Georgia 2007)

I’ll dream up tales and rhymes
In visionary dream
This precious moment of my life
Holds me excited
I will fly away
To reach the heights I’ve ever dreamed
Beneath the sun
No sense of time and space
And dissipation of your light
Holds me excited
Clouds containing lakes
And in the haze of morning light
I feel embraced
Sailing through my story
Sharing my history
Sailing through my story
Sharing my history
Ah… ah ah…
Sailing through my story
Sharing my history
Sailing through my story
Sharing my history
The precious moment of my life
Holds me excited
The meditation of my dreams
Holds me delighted
I will fly away
To reach the ambience I’ve dreamed
Beneath the sun
Sailing through my story
Sharing my history
Sailing through my story
Sharing my history

Dihaj – Skeletons (Azerbaijan 2017)
Standing in a mirror lane, wondering what to do
Another day and gravity’s got, got another hold of me
I never dreamed that this could be happening, not to me
But if he came falling down falling so hard, I started believing

Now I’m into daydreams, amazed by thorn jeans
Deep into high extremes
When I’m with him it’s fantasy, we’re just like alchemy
Oh I feel ready

Have my skeletons (I can only trick you once, bad boy)
Have my lungs, my millions (Talk is cheap don’t speak in tongues, bad boy)
Drum drum drum, bring out the guns (Drum drum drum, bring out the guns, bad boy)
I’m so so cursed (Fuss and fight won’t get you tons)
Bad boy

The world is spinning faster by the minute and I’m longing to be saved
This bitter sweet sensation got a, got another hold of me

Now I’m stuck in daydreams, surrounded by thorn jeans
Deep into high extremes
When we hook up it’s fantasy, we’re just like alchemy
I’ve never been so ready

Have my skeletons (I can only trick you once, bad boy)
Have my lungs, my millions (Talk is cheap don’t speak in tongues, bad boy)
Drum drum drum, bring out the guns (Drum drum drum, bring out the guns, bad boy)
I’m so so cursed (Fuss and fight won’t get you tons)
Bad boy

(I can only trick you once, bad boy) I can only trick you once
(Talk is cheap don’t speak in tongues, bad boy) (Talk is cheap don’t speak in tongues, bad boy)
Talk is cheap don’t speak in tongues
(Drum drum drum, bring out the guns, bad boy) Drum drum drum, bring out the guns
Bad boy
Fuss and fight won’t get you tons, bad boy (Fuss and fight won’t get you tons)

Have my skeletons (I can only trick you once, bad boy)
Have my lungs, my millions (Talk is cheap don’t speak in tongues, bad boy)
Have my skeletons (Drum drum drum, bring out the guns, bad boy)
I’m so so cursed (Fuss and fight won’t get you tons)
Have my skeletons

Jessica Mauboy – We Got Love (Australia 2018)
Why do we always feel like we need to try?
Why do we believe that we need to be somebody else
To feel alive?
Why do we make
Why do we keep making the same mistakes?
And believing that it won't make a difference if we try
To break away

I know, I know what you must be thinking
That we are powerless to change things
But don't, don't give up
'Cause we got love, 'cause we got love
I won't throw my hands up to surrender
'Cause love is stronger than fire
So don't, don't give up
'Cause we got love, 'cause we got love

Time, don't you think it's just a waste of time?
When we're always fighting over material trivial things
In this life, yeah
I don't understand why we don't get it right

Why do we keep going round and round?
At the end of the day, we've only got ourselves to blame

I know, I know what you must be thinking
That we are powerless to change things
But don't, don't give up
'Cause we got love, 'cause we got love
I won't throw my hands up to surrender
'Cause love is stronger than fire
So don't, don't give up
'Cause we got love, 'cause we got love

(We got love)
(We got love) We got love, we got love
(We got love) We got love

I know, I know what you must be thinking
That we are powerless to change things
But don't, don't give up
'Cause we got love, 'cause we got love
I won't throw my hands up to surrender
'Cause love is stronger than fire
So don't, don't give up
'Cause we got love, 'cause we got love, 'cause we got love

Alma – Requiem (France 2017)
Love dies, love is born
Centuries pass and disappear
What you believe to be death
It's a season and nothing more

One day tired of this wandering
You will go away, whatever
Because the world will still turn
Even when we won't turn anymore

Kiss me, tell me that you love me
Make me smile in the middle of a requiem
Kiss me, tell me that you love me
Make me dance until time takes back from us

What it gave to us
A year, two years, a hundred years of happiness
Then life picks you like a flower
Make me laugh I need it
While waiting for the time

A year, two years, a hundred years together
And then one day we're all alone
We cry but we still survive
It's the beauty of a requiem

The sparks become flames
The little girls become women
What you believe to be death
It's an inferno and nothing more

Our rips, our declines
They're thought to be important
But tomorrow the day will be reborn
Like if we have not lived

Kiss me, tell me that you love me
Make me smile in the middle of a requiem
Kiss me, tell me that you love me
Make me dance until time takes back from us

What it gave to us
A year, two years, a hundred years of happiness
Then life picks you like a flower
Make me laugh I need it
While waiting for the time

A year, two years, a hundred years together
And then one day we're all alone
We cry but we still survive
It's the beauty of a requiem

Love is born, love dies
Tonight I'm finally not afraid
I know that I will love you again
When the world doesn't turn anymore

Love is born, love dies
Tonight I'm finally not afraid
I know that I will still love you
When the world won't turn anymore

Kiss me, tell me that you love me
Make me smile in the middle of a requiem
Kiss me, tell me that you love me
Make me dance until time takes back from us

What it gave to us
What it gave to us
What it gave to us
What it gave to us
What it gave to us

Elnur & Samir – Day After Day (Azerbaijan 2008)

For peace we pray
Save us from all fears
Oh Lord, save us...

You can feel me in your mind
With every breath you take
Burn the earth with flame of sins
I'll make you feel dismay

Our feelings play with us
But you must keep yourself under control
If you're searching for resolves
Be ready for the tolls

Show us the right way
Day after day
All fears we must forget
Then better world we'll get

If you have the greatest aim
Keep it in your soul
I'll be always by your side
Always in your heart

Our dreams can play with us
Even if we think that we keep control
From all horrors of the world
Salvation is love, love

The earth is in flame
And you must share the blame
Look inside yourself
We both are there

Day after day
Day after day
Day...

Day after day
All fears we must forget
Then better world we'll get
Then better world we'll get
Then better world we'll get
Then better world we'll get

Alfred & Amaia – Tu Canción (Spain 2018)
I never imagined
that flying to the moon would happen
You turn everything upside down
when you kiss my forehead and I understand why
I can no longer
Make it up
I feel like I'm dancing for the first time
you are the art that sweetens the skin
 of my traveler mind that follows your steps
I feel like I'm dancing for the first time when I'm with you
I know that in you I can find
the voice that can cover me when the weather turns bad
Everything's perfect when you're here,
creating a new city with me
I feel like I'm dancing for the first time
you are the art that sweetens the skin
of my traveler mind that follows your steps
I feel like I'm dancing for the first time
I can no longer
Make it up
I just want
Your song...
I feel like I'm dancing for the first time
you are the art that sweetens the skin
My traveler mind follows your steps
I feel like I'm dancing for the first time when I'm with you

Duo Datz – Kan (Israel 1991)

Here is my home where I was born, on the plains just by the sea,
Here are my friends with whom I grew up,
And there's no other place in the world for me.
No other place in the world for me.

Here is my home where I frolicked, in the land that's beyond the heights,
Here from the well I drank water,
And planted grass in the wastes,
And planted grass in the wastes.

I was born here, my children were born here,
Here I built my house with both my hands,
Here you're with me, and all my thousand of friends,
And my wanderings are over after two thousand years.

Here I played all of my songs,
And went out on a night journey.
Here in my youth I protected, this piece of God given land.
This piece of God given land.

I was born here, my children were born here,
Here I built my house with both my hands,
Here you're with me, and all my thousand of friends,
And my wanderings are over after two thousand years.

Here

Here I set my table, a piece of bread, and a beautiful flower.
A door to my neighbors I opened,
And to those who come we'll say "welcome."
And to those who come we'll say "welcome."

I was born here, my children were born here,
Here I built my house with both my hands,
Here you're with me, and all my thousand of friends,
And after two thousand years,
And after two thousand years.

I was born here, my children were born here,
Here I built my house with both my hands,
Here you're with me, and all my thousand of friends,
And my wanderings are over after two thousand years.
Here you're with me, and all my thousand of friends,
And my wanderings are over after two thousand years.

Vanja Radovanović- Inje (Montenegro 2018)

Frost has formed between us
Blood in our veins freezes thus
Your heart is a dying ember
So you no longer remember

Love quivers like a tender leaf
Frozen in sommer, defying belief
I tremble too, all the way through
Since we were parted, me and you

In vain the quilt warms my body whole
A colddraught blows right through my Soul

The days drag by as in a dream
Even when I win, I lose, it seems
But when no one is there to see
My heart will bid you visit me

I live my life by worn Routine
Like a slave alone, unseen
But when no one is there to hear
My heart rejoices with a cheer

Me and life - like dog and cat
The heart the most treasured pet

The days drag by as in a dream
Even when I win, I lose, it seems
But when no one is there to see
My heart will bid you visit me

I live my life by worn Routine
Like a slave alone, unseen
But when no one is there to hear
My heart rejoices with a cheer

Frost has formed

Elnur Huseynov – Hour of the Wolf (Azerbaijan 2015)

I hold my breath, I’m on the edge
Storming hills, I’ve been lost and found
I hope they’re coming, I can hear them running
I once met peace, he said that he
Soon would have the answers to this hurt
And my mind was made up, I would never give up
No, I won’t sleep tonight
If tomorrow comes I’ll lose my mind
I won’t give up my right
I know every heart deserves a fight
I will beat on the drum, rise above with me
I will go till I’m numb, rise above with me
No, I won’t sleep tonight
They whine and roar, hungry for more
Yellow glowing eyes, I’m hypnotized
I feel brave yet scared, but I’ll stay prepared
Oh, have my soul, it’s destined
It’s written in the sky
Let me not be blinded by this hurt
Set him loose, I’m ready for the stars to guide me
No, I won’t sleep tonight
If tomorrow comes I’ll lose my mind
No, I won’t sleep tonight
If tomorrow comes I’ll lose my mind
I won’t give up my right
I know every heart deserves a fight
I will beat on the drum, rise above with me
I will go till I’m numb, rise above with me
No, I won’t sleep tonight
No, I won’t sleep tonight
If tomorrow comes I’ll lose my mind

Alyosha – Sweet People (Ukraine 2010)

Oh, sweet people
What have we done?
Tell me what is happening?
For all that we've built
Tumbles and is gone

Oh, sweet people
Have you no love for mankind?
Must you go on killing
Just to pass the time

The message is so true
The end is really near
All these feelings take me down
It steals the things so dear
Yes, the message is so real
Don't turn all the earth to stone
Because, because, because
This is your home

Oh, sweet people
What about our children?
In theaters and video games
They watch what we send to ruin

Oh, sweet people
What senseless game
Have we all been playing?
No one but you to blame?

The message is so true
The end is really near
All these feelings take me down
It steals the things so dear
Yes, the message is so real
Don't turn all the earth to stone
Because, because, because
This is your home

This is our home

Azúcar Moreno – Bandido (Spain 1990)

The moon bewitched me and led me to you
I drank happily the poison of love
Even though it burned my chest and my skin
It tasted sweet like honey

Your eyes, bandit, stole with lies the blood
and the life of my heart
Your absence in my nights causes sadness
Sighs and tears, and dark passion

And now when every time you leave my side
I feel that the pain grows more and more

Your eyes, bandit, stole with lies the blood
and the life of my heart
Your absence in my nights causes sadness
Sighs and tears, and dark passion

Hold me with fury of a hurricane
The fire of your love is like a volcano
And then kiss me, catch me in your net
And at last your lips quenches my thirst

Your eyes, bandit, stole with lies the blood
and the life of my heart
Your absence in my nights causes sadness
Sighs and tears, and dark passion

Your eyes, bandit, stole with lies the blood
and the life of my heart
Your absence in my nights causes sadness
Sighs and tears, and dark passion

Rasmussen – Higher Ground (Denmark 2018)

Ships in the making
Bound for a distant shore
World for the taking
Men gone forever more
Boarding and setting sail
Yet, victory won't prevail

Freeze the arrow in the air
Make your mark and leave it hanging there
Be the first to turn around
Take the leap to land on higher ground

Call in, surrender
Still, I won't feel like defeat
Men laying down their swords
Each of their own accord

Freeze the arrow in the air
Make your mark and leave it hanging there
Be the first to turn around
Take the leap to land on higher ground

Raise the banner to the sky
Face the fear and hold your head up high
Oooh-oooh, oooh-oooh
Take the leap like you were bound for higher ground

Freeze the arrow in the air
Make your mark and leave it hanging there

Freeze the arrow in the air
Make your mark and leave it hanging there
Be the first to turn around
Take the leap to land on higher ground
Be the first to turn around
Take the leap and land on higher ground

Girl, girl, girl, can’t you see what you do to me tonight?
Boy, boy, boy, if you’re mean, I will start a fight tonight
You and I could try to stop – uh boy, till you drop

Maja Keuc – No One (Slovenia 2011)

And you came to me one night
Like a morning light
Just to hold me tight
Then you left and I was so alone
Saying I should’ve known
You’re no good for me

There’s no reason I should cry
No, no baby, I’ll survive
I don’t care, I don’t care

No one will ever hold you tight
No one will ever love you like
Just no one like I do
There is no one, no one

No one will ever treat you right
You’re the one who’s never satisfied
There is no one like I, like I am

I can feel what you’re looking for
I’m not that girl no more
I’m not made of stone
I’m gonna stand on my own
Not gonna break me down
No one will stop me now

No, no, no, no… ’cause life is kind without you
And I know I can make it through without you

Life goes all around
Round and round and round
I feel love for sure
And it’s gonna get you

Life goes all around
Spinning all around
Now you want me, don’t you

Safura – Drip Drop (Azerbaijan 2010)

You are my man
You are my half
Tell me what's happening
I know something's wrong
I can tell when you lie
I can tell you stopped trying

And these last three weeks passed and we barely talk
I think I know and it's breaking my heart
Am I in or am I out?

Can I love you forever through this?
Can I trust in you forever through this?
I don't know how to stop
How to stop
These tear drops
That drip drop, drip drop
Drip drop, drip drop
These tear drops
That drip drop, drip drop
Drip drop, drip drop

Tell me where have you been?
Why are you late?
You smell like lipstick, again
Come on, answer my question, say something
Why are you acting out? Or say it's in my head
I don't wanna end

Can I love you forever through this?
Can I trust in you forever through this?
I don't know how to stop
How to stop
These tear drops
That drip drop, drip drop
Drip drop, drip drop

I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna hear your name
If this is how it is
I don't wanna run
Run away from myself
And be lost again

Oh no no no, oh no no no
Forever through this?
I don't know how to stop
How to stop
These tear drops
That drip drop, drip drop
Drip drop, drip drop

These tear drops
That drip drop, drip drop
Drip drop, drip drop




Regina – Bistra voda (Bosnia & Herzegovina 2009)

I’ve asked some people in my neighborhood
where does my soul live
One secret for me
they say you’re keeping, my dear
I’ve asked them to give me back
the time, days, hours,
There’s love scent
in the Spring
they say
Give me birth
at a May dawn
Bathe me
in clear water
I’m keeping a flower
when everybody else leaves
I’m keeping you
for as long as I live
Steal a bit of sun for us
there’s no tomorrow, no today
It’s easy
when a song finds your heart
Give me birth
at a May dawn
Bathe me
in clear water
I’m keeping a flower
when everybody else leaves
I’m keeping you
for as long as I live
Give me birth
at a May dawn
Bathe me
in clear water
I’m keeping a flower
when everybody else leaves
I’m keeping you
for as long as I live

I’m searching for the space and time in life
And I wonder: where could it be?
Where my soul is supposed to be
Can you tell me, love?
They say you keep a secret from me
No more lies, just give me back those days at nights
And the breeze of early spring
In the morning light
Wake me up on a precious morning
But when the hope is fading away
Remember to hold on
There will be better days
Bring us sunshine, bring us moonlight
There’s no hope, no happy ending in the dark
Let the music reach our hearts
Wake me up on a precious morning
But when the hope is fading away
Remember to hold on
There will be better days
Wake me up on a precious morning
But when the hope is fading away
Remember to hold on
There will be better days

Gigliola Cinquetti – Sì (Italy 1974)

I walked a little, following his steps
And who knows why I wasn't laughing anymore
The grass leaned upon my dress
It was as if I was saying goodbye
I can't read my thoughts anymore
But then the atmosphere cleared up
And I had to say yes to him

Yes, my mind said yes
Out of fear or out of love
I never asked myself about it
Yes, I softly said yes
To feel an emotion
That I've never had before
And when in his face
The whole sky cleared up
Yes, yes

I can't remember anymore what happened after that
Maybe I woke up or I fell asleep
And in my dreams, there were wide prairies
And your hands were holding mine
We ran and then, we ran and then
And then the atmosphere cleared up
And I said yes to you once again
Yes

Yes, I softly said yes
To feel an emotion
That I've never had before
And when in his face
The whole sky cleared up

Yes (I said yes to love)
(And I would say yes to you every night like then)
Yes, yes

Nina Sublatti – Warrior (Georgia 2015)
Fighter
Oximated
World's gonna get up and see

I'm a warrior
Isolated
World's gonna listen to me

Violence
Set it free
Wings are gonna spread out

I'm a warrior
Isolated
World's gonna get up and see

Woohoo

I'm a warrior
Still stuck in my mind
I've been in danger for too long
No no no

Woohoo

I'm a warrior
Still stuck in my mind
I've been in danger for too long
No

Not a shabby
Or a money maker
World's gonna light up in peace

Not in shadows
Bright a little
Not your fault you're just gonna breathe

Violence
Break me free
Wings are gonna spread up
I'm a warrior
Oximated
I'm gonna get up and be

Woohoo
I'm a warrior
Still stuck in my mind
I've been in danger for too long
No no no

Grethe & Jørgen Ingmann – Dansevise (Denmark 1963)

A ray of sunshine in a puddle
A little kiss on the cheek from a wind
And the rush, humming
That life's beginning
It's a web in your mind

A whistle of silver from a treetop
A faint sound of a cat grabbing
A ripple in the stream
A whisper in the hedge
That says, that it isn't night anymore

The meadow is wet with dew
Lady Dawn goes to bed
Day gets up playfully
And crossing the bridge of the sun

And the two of us?
What about the two of us?
Yes, what about the two of us, you and me?
I'm dancing and dancing and stopping
And sensing only you
Why ever did you run away?

Come back, come back
Come back, you my beloved friend
Come back, come back
Wherever you wish, are we dancing to

Come, let us dance
Everything can happen
Come, let us dance
Let us dance, let us laugh

A whistle of silver from a treetop
A faint sound of a cat grabbing
A ripple in the stream
A whisper in the hedge
That says, that it isn't night anymore

The meadow is wet with dew
Lady Dawn goes to bed
Day gets up playfully
And crossing the bridge of the sun

And the two of us?
What about the two of us?
Yes, what about the two of us, you and me?
I'm dancing and dancing and stopping
And sensing only you
Why ever did you run away?
Come back, come back

Beloved friend

Brotherhood of Man – Save Your Kisses for Me (United Kingdom 1976)

Although it hurts to go away it's impossible to stay
But there's one thing I must say before I go
I love you (i love you) you know
I'll be thinking of you in most everything I do

Now the time is moving on and I really should be gone
But you keep me hanging on for one more smile
I love you (i love you) all the while
With your cute little away will you promise that you'll save

Your kisses for me save all your kisses for me
Bye bye baby bye bye don't cry honey don't cry
Going to walk out this door but I'll soon be back for more
Kisses for me save all your kisses for me
So long honey so long hang on baby hang on
Don't you dare me to stay 'cause you know I'll have to say
That I've got to work each day and that's why I go away
But I count the seconds till I'm home with you
I love you (i love you) it's true
You're so cute honey gee won't you save them up for me

Your kisses for me save all your kisses for me
Bye bye baby bye bye don't cry honey don't cry
Going to walk out this door but I'll soon be back for more
Kisses for me save all your kisses for me
So long honey so long hang on baby hang on
Don't you dare me to stay 'cause you know you've got to save
Your kisses for me save all your kisses for me
Bye bye baby bye bye don't cry honey don't cry
Won't you save them for me even though you're only three

Valentina Monetta – Crisalide (Vola) (San Marino 2013)

Sometimes inside of me
I felt an emptiness that
Called me from within itself
Come now to see the truth
There is a bridge over the immensity

What in the end am
I, a fragile dream of God
With a body made as it is
Big eyes, seemingly alive, one dies
Renewed for eternity

Fly, fly, that the strength will come
Always alone toward another freedom
The new butterfly always leaves behind
The chrysalis that was you
Empty without me

From the clouds one knows
That rain will fall
Suddenly occur
The wings wet with tears that do not dry
Then the wind will come

And you fly, fly, fly away from yourself
Always alone until a reflection appears
In the mirror which breaks the image
Into a thousand pieces of vertigo
And light scintillates

How much life there is
I had never known
And if you still do not realize
We are the universe

Fly, that the strength will come
Never again alone in true freedom
The new butterfly leaves behind
The chrysalis and more
Empty without me

Fly in the joy you will
Never again be alone in the immensity of us
In an instant love like the return of sunny days
Will change everything

Fly, fly, fly with me

Edsilia – Hemel en aarde (The Netherlands 1998)

The Netherlands were cool and chilly, and especially the weather
The wind, it never fell, my love life all the more
What I read in your eyes lightened my fire
It’s quite often underrated, the force of nature

Heaven and earth are moving when you’re in front of me
For me it’s proven that fate exists
Heaven and earth are opening when you touch me
I never wanted to believe, but there’s more
Between heaven and earth

Black skies are breaking open on the horizon
Now I’ll warm myself by the rays of the sun (Rays of the sun)
I’ve tried love, it was never what it seemed
But I saw the future when I looked into your eyes

Heaven and earth are moving when you’re in front of me
For me it’s proven that fate exists
Heaven and earth are opening when you touch me
I never wanted to believe, but there’s more

(Heaven and earth are moving) When you’re in front of me
(For me it’s proven) Oh, that fate exists
Heaven and earth are opening when you touch me
I never wanted to believe, but there’s more

(Heaven and earth) Oh hayah… huah…
(Heaven and earth) Ahaha, ahaha, ahahahahuah..
(Heaven and earth) Ah ah ah, ah… huah ah…
(Heaven and earth) Ah…

(Heaven and earth are moving) When you’re in front of me
(Het is voor mij bewezen) Oh, that fate exists
(Heaven and earth are opening) Heaven and earth
(When you touch me) Hey…

I never wanted to believe, but there’s more, oho…
Between heaven and earth

Olsen Brothers – Fly on the Wings of Love (Denmark 2000)
In the summer nights
When the moon shines bright
Feeling love forever
And the heat is on
When the daylight's gone
Still happy together

There's just one more thing I'd like to add
She's the greatest love I've ever had

Fly on the wings of love
Fly, baby, fly
Reaching the stars above
Touching the sky

And as time goes by
There's a lot to try
And I'm feelin' lucky
In the softest sand
Smiling hand in hand
Love is all around me

There's just one more thing I'd like to add
She's the greatest love I've ever had

Fly on the wings of love
Fly, baby, fly
Reaching the stars above
Touching the sky

If you just fly
(Fly, baby, fly)
Fly on the wings of love
(On the wings of love)
Reaching the stars above
(Fly, baby, fly)
Touching the sky

Fly on the wings of love
Fly, baby, fly
Reaching the stars above
Touching the sky

Fly on the wings of love
(Fly, baby, fly)
Fly, baby, fly
(On the wings of love)
Reaching the stars above
(Fly, baby, fly)
Touching the sky
If you just fly
On wings of love

Joy Fleming – Ein Lied kann eine Brücke sein (Germany 1975)

Look at your life
What's it been like?
Years, they're just going round in circles
You want to change yourself
But nobody breaks the ice, ooh...

Then you're talking to people
Who mean nothing to you
Look, they're feeling just the same as you
But there are still roads
Which lead directly to me
Oh baby

A song can be a bridge
And each tone is like a stone
Making it strong and stable
You can walk over it
Understand the others

A song can be a bridge
Have a little courage and sing along
And if your heart is ready
Come over this bridge
Away from your loneliness

Stop playing and learn how to feel
How many people are friends
Learn how to sing, trust just like a child
Oh baby!

A song can be a bridge
And each tone is like a stone
Making it strong and stable
You can walk over it
Understand the others

A song can be a bridge
Have a little courage and sing along
And if your heart is ready
Come over this bridge
Away from your loneliness

(Nananana nananana...)
(Nananana nananana...)
(Nana nana nana...)

So come on and get movin'
Walk across the Bridge of...
Come on and get movin'
Walk across the Bridge of...
Come on and get movin'
Walk across the Bridge of Love!

Dalal & Deen, ft. Ana Rucner & Jala – Ljubav je (Bosnia & Herzegovina 2016)

I'll need your body,
When I close my eyes,
Everything around is me white,
Even the gray walls.

I have nowhere to get back,
I only believe to you,
I'll pay all my debts,
I swear to love.

Love is enchanted circle,
Everybody'll have turn,
Everybody'll pay debts,
Love is everything we have,
Everybody choose own sin,
We are forgiving to each other,
Forgiving.

I need your body,
When I close my eyes,
My heart swore to you,
How can I forgive you?

I have nowhere to get back,
I only believe to you,
I'll pay all my debts,
I swear to love.

Instead of being captain, I chose to be pirate,
Instead of being happy, I chose sadness in spite,
My story is roulette, I'm only paying, never wining,
I'm cursed by her eyes, I can't laugh anymore,
Then she lures my with warmth after two to three glass of vines,
But she is not the one who will give a birth to my son,
But she is the only one who can touch me that magically,
And now I'm drunk again because have no piece.

Love is enchanted circle,
Everybody'll have turn,
Everybody'll pay debts,
Love is everything we have,
Everybody choose own sin,
We are forgiving to each other,
Forgiving.

Sebaltar – Hunter of Stars (Switzerland 2014)

Looking for a candidate
You have an option, only one choice
Sipping my drinks, looking around
There’s so much beauty, oh, yes we can

But yet self-confidence is a fragile concept
That often fades away in the night
And there it comes, that unwanted guest
There is no place for you tonight

Want me to go, want me to go
‘Cause you think I’m lying, ’cause you think I’m lying
No, open the door
‘Cause tonight I cannot go hunting for stars, no no

Like an evil satellite
Twisting the truth then leaving us alone
In this mad and moody world
Society without love

I state my heart has been well trained
I’m gonna be your candidate
I am the hunter and you are the prey
Tonight I’m gonna eat you up

Want me to go, want me to go
‘Cause you think I’m lying, ’cause you think I’m lying
No, open the door
‘Cause tonight I cannot go hunting for stars

I press my nose to the glass
It’s raining outside, it’s raining outside
I would like to storm in
Roar like a lion, roar like a lion

But I fear your judgement, oh, I fear your judgement
I’m so wet, I’m dirty
But I fear your judgement, oh, I fear your judgement
It’s me and my imperfection

Want me to go, want me to go
‘Cause you think I’m lying, ’cause you think I’m lying
No, open the door
‘Cause tonight I cannot go hunting for stars, no no

Maria Guinot – Silêncio e tanta gente (Portugal 1984)

Sometimes it’s in the midst of silence
I find love in the look of your eyes
It’s a stone,
it’s a shout
Born anywhere

Sometimes it’s in the midst of so many people
I find at last what I am
I’m a shout
or I’m a stone
From a place where I’m not

Sometimes I’m the time running slowly
And what no one wants to believe

Sometimes I’m also
a happy yes
or a sad no
And I give my life for a day of illusion
And I give my life for a day of illusion

Sometimes it’s in the midst of silence
I find the words to say
It’s a stone
or it’s a shout
Of a love yet to happen

Sometimes it’s in the midst of so many people
I find at last where I’m going
And this stone,
and this shout
Is the story of what I am

Sometimes I’m the time running slowly
And what no one wants to believe

Sometimes I’m also
a happy yes
or a sad no
And I give my life for a day of illusion
And I give my life for a day of illusion

Sometimes I’m the time running slowly
And what no one wants to believe

Sometimes I’m also
a happy yes
or a sad no
And I give my life for a day of illusion
And I give my life for a day of illusion

Athena – For Real (Turkey 2004)

Ohh... Comin' up, comin' up, comin' up now
What you doing?
What you waiting for?
Ohh, it's time to push it, break it, rush it
Don't ever let life pass you by

All I know is you don't want to be part of the crowd
Realize yourself
You say it but don't feel it
What you're sayin' has no meanin'
Don't hide your soul
For real, I'm for real
Come on

Up, I wanna bring you up
I wanna bring you up
I wanna bring you up
I wanna bring you up
Do you want, do you want
Up, I wanna bring you up, up
I wanna bring you up

Please, please
No questions, no answers
No more runnin' around in circles
Are you in, are you out?
Do you know your way out?
Let me take you up, into sky
For real, I'm for real
Come on

Up, I wanna bring you up
I wanna bring you up
I wanna bring you up
I wanna bring you up
Do you want, do you want
Up, I wanna bring you up, up
I wanna bring you up

I wanna bring you up
I wanna bring you up
I wanna bring you up
I wanna bring you up
Do you want, do you want
Up, I wanna bring you up, up
I wanna bring you!

Come on
Come on
Risin' up now, risin' up now...






Dima Bilan – Believe (Russia 2008)
Even when the thunder and storm begins
I’ll be standing strong like a tree in the wind
Nothing’s gonna move this mountain
or change my direction

I’m falling off the sky
and I’m all alone
The courage that’s inside is gonna break my fall
Nothing’s gonna dim my light within

But if I keep going on
it will never be impossible
Not today

‘Cause I’ve got something to believe in
As long as I’m breathing
There is not a limit to what I can dream
‘Cause I got something to believe in
Mission to keep climbing
Nothing else can stop me if I just believe
and I believe in me

Even when the world tries to pull me down
Tell me that I can ,try to turn me around
I won’t let them put my fire out, without no
But if I keep going on
It will never be impossible
Not today

Yes, I got something to believe in
As long as I’m breathing
There is not a limit to what I can dream
‘Cause I got something to believe in
Mission to keep climbing
Nothing else can stop me if I just believe
And I believe

I can do it all
Open every door
Turn unthinkable to reality
You see, I can do it all and more

Believing, as long as I’m breathing
There is not a limit to what I can dream
Believing, mission to keep climbing
Nothing else can stop me if I just believe
And I believe in me

Charlotte Nilsson – Take Me to Your Heaven (Sweden 1998)

Shadows dancing slowly on my wall
Moonlight painting silver to the
Sound of heartbeat
Magical emotions take control
Knowing we will meet before the night is over
Then I gonna make you mine
Love you till the end of time

Take me to your heaven
Hold on to a dream
Take me to your heaven
When my nights are cold and lonely
Flying high together
On a journey to the stars
Won't you take me to your heaven, to your heart

I can feel your body next to mine
Reaching for a kiss that keeps me warm and tender
Seven steps to heaven, show the way
When I'm there I give myself the sweet surrender
Then I gonna make you mine
Love you till the end of time

Take me to your heaven
Hold on to a dream
Take me to your heaven
When my nights are cold and lonely
Flying high together
On a journey to the stars
Won't you take me to your heaven, to your heart

As dawn is breaking, there is so much more to say
So will you be my one and only
When nights are lonely
Hold on time forever
Take me to your heaven
Hold on to a dream
Take me to your heaven
When my nights are cold and lonely
Flying high together
On a journey to the stars
Won't you take me to your heaven, to your heart
Won't you take me to your heaven, to your heart

"Fångad av en stormvind" Carola 1991
I have never stopped believing
That after every night waits the dawn
Even though I can't understand
There's time for laughter when I start all over again
 I can smell the scent from a quiet ocean
Suddenly I'm in the middle of a vivid hurricane

I am captured by a stormwind, stuck on you
Nothing can stop me, when it's blowing in my heart
Captured by a stormwind night and day
Only you and I are here, and the light that heaven left behind

It is time to move on
For the moments that have passed, never come back
Travelling on an open sea
Where everything is like new in the future you give
 I'm leaving my safe harbour without missing it
Free, but still tied to open arms

I am captured by a stormwind, stuck on you
Nothing can stop me, when it's blowing in my heart
Captured by a stormwind night and day
Only you and I are here, and the light that heaven left behind
 We are walking together, united by the bonds of love
My longing is awakened, when you smile and give me your hand

I am captured by a stormwind
Captured by a stormwind, (stuck on you)
Nothing can stop me, when it's blowing in my heart
Captured by a stormwind night and day
Only you and I are here, and the light that heaven left behind

(Captured by a stormwind)
I am captured by a stormwind



Nicole – Ein bißchen Frieden (Germany 1982)
Just like a flower when winter begins
Just like a candle blown out in the wind
Just like a bird that can no longer fly
I’m feeling that way sometime
But then, as I’m falling, weighed down by the load
I picture a light at the end of the road
And closing my eyes, I can see through the dark
The dream that is in my heart
A little lovin’, a little givin’
To build a dream for the world we live in
A little patience and understanding
For our tomorrow, a little peace
A little sunshine, a sea of gladness
To wash away all the tears of sadness
A little hoping, a little praying
For our tomorrow, a little peace
I feel I’m a leaf in the November snow
I fell to the ground, there was no one below
So now I am helpless, alone with my song
Just wishing the storm was gone
A little lovin’, a little givin’
To build a dream for the world we live in
A little patience and understanding
For our tomorrow, a little peace
A little sunshine, a sea of gladness
To wash away all the tears of sadness
A little hoping, a little praying
For our tomorrow, a little peace
We are feathers on the breeze
(A little lovin’, a little givin’)
(To build a dream for the world we live in)
Sing with me my song of peace
(A little patience and understanding)
(For our tomorrow, a little peace)
We are feathers on the breeze
(A little sunshine, a sea of gladness)
(To wash away all the tears of sadness)
Sing with me my song of peace
(A little hoping, a little praying)
(For our tomorrow, a little peace)


Séverine – Un banc, un arbre, une rue (Monaco 1971)
We all have a bench, a tree or a street
Where we have rocked our dreams
We all have a bench, a tree or a street
A childhood too short

One day or another must leave
To build a future, a future
And see is the unforgettable moment
Where we make his clothes child, child

Each one flies away with hope
On the path he has chosen, which he has chosen
Towards wealth or glory
Yet whatever our purpose, our goal

We all have a bench ...
Everyone in his corner is
defending only his ambitions, his ambitions
Even if we do not share anything

What do we have in common, in common?
We all have a bench ...
La la la la la .........

Sandra Kim – J’aime la vie (Belgium 1986)
I see people bend their backs
As if life is worth nothing
Me, I’m fifteen and I’m telling you
Whoa whoa… I love life
(I love life- life, all of life)
I too, must believe
The flashes of hope, the sleeplessness
But sum-total, addition
I love the horizon, I love, I love life
(Even if it’s crazy)
I love, I love life
(Bravo for the challenge)
I love, I love life
Don’t blame me
I’m not like that
I love, I love life
Whoa… and nevermind
If it rains too much on me
Whoa whoa… you are
Before Jacques Brel, before Mozart
I feel small, I’m depressed
I am nothing but a speck of dust
In this universe
(That’s life, life, all of life)
But say that you love me, say that you smile
My joys enchant them for infinity
There’s no more Brel, no more Mozart
My life restarts
I love, I love life
(Even if it’s crazy)
I love, I love life
(Bravo for the challenge)
I love, I love life
Don’t blame me
I’m not like that
I love, I love life
Nevermind if it rains a bit much on me
I love, I love life
(Even if it’s crazy)
I love, I love life
(Bravo for the challenge)
I love, I love life
Don’t blame me
I’m not like that
I love, I love life
(Even if it’s crazy)
I love, I love life
(Bravo for the challenge)
For the days that don’t
I have something
I count on you
I love, I love life
Whoa… and nevermind
If it rains a bit much on me
Whoa whoa… life- yes, you are

Bucks Fizz – Making Your Mind Up (United Kingdom 1981)

You gotta speed it up, and then you gotta slow it down
Coz if you believe that our love can hit the top you gotta play around
But soon you will find that there comes a time
For making your mind up

You gotta turn it on, and then you gotta put it out
You gotta be sure that it's something everybody's gonna talk about
Before you decide that the times arrived
For making your mind up

Don't let your indecision take you from behind
Trust your inner vision, don't let others change your mind

And then you really gotta burn it up and make another fly by night
Get a run for your money and take a chance and it'll turn out right
And when you can see how it's gotta be
You're making your mind up

And try to look as if you don't care less but if you want to see some more
Bending the rules of the game will let you find the one you're looking for
And then you can show that you think you know
You're making your mind up

Don't let your indecision, take you from behind
Trust your inner vision, don't let others change your mind

And now you really gotta speed it up, and then you gotta slow it down
Coz if you believe that our love can hit the top you gotta play around
But soon you will find that there comes a time
For making your mind up

And now you really gotta speed it up, and then you gotta slow it down
Coz if you believe that our love can hit the top you gotta play around
But soon you will find that there comes a time
For making your mind up

For making your mind up
For making your mind up
For making your mind up

Frida Boccara – Un jour, un enfant (France 1969)
A day will dawn
Over three branches of lilacs
That a child will behold
Just like a picture book

The world around him
Will be empty, and so
He'll imagine life
From a blank page

By drawing the shape of an orange
He'll give the sky its first sun
By drawing the bird
He'll invent the flowers
By searching the sound of the water
He'll hear the cry of the heart

By drawing the points of a star
This very child will find the path
Of the grown people who still
Look amazed
At the fruits of every day
And at the roses of love

Toto Cutugno – Insieme: 1992 (Italy 1990)
Together, unite, unite, Europe
With you, so far and different
With you, a friend that I thought I’d lost
You and I, having the same dream
Together, unite, unite, Europe
And for you, a woman without borders
With you, under the same flags
You and I, under the same sky
Together, unite, unite, Europe
We’re more and more free
It’s no longer a dream and you’re no longer alone
We’re higher and higher
Give me your hand, so that we can fly
Europe is not far away
This is an Italian song for you
Together, unite, unite, Europe
For us, in heaven a thousand violins
For us, love without borders
You and I, having the same ideals, mmm…
Together, unite, unite, Europe
We’re more and more free
It’s no longer a dream and we’re no longer alone
We’re uniting more and more
Give me your hand and you will see you’re flying
Europe is not far away
This is an Italian song for you
Together, unite, unite, Europe
We’re more and more free
More and more free
Our stars, one single flag
We’re stronger and stronger
Stronger and stronger
Give me your hand and you will see yourself flying
Europe is not far away
This is an Italian song for you
Together, unite, unite, Europe
Europe is not far away
This is an Italian song for you
Together, unite, unite, Europe

Alice & Franco Battiato – I treni di tozeur (Italy 1984)
In the border villages, they watch the trains pass,
The deserted streets of Tozeur

From a far-off house, your mother sees me
She remembers me and my habits

And for a moment, the wanting to live
At a different speed returns

They still pass slowly, the trains to Tozeur

In the abandoned churches they prepare refuges
And new spaceships for interstellar trips

In an old mine, expanses of salt
And a memory of me, like a charm

And for a moment, the wanting to live
At a different speed returns

They still pass slowly, the trains to Tozeur

In the border villages, they watch the passing
Trains to Tozeur







Tajci – Hajde da ludujemo (Yugoslavia 1990)
Come on, honey
Co… come on, honey, and…
Don’t pretend to be Mister Cool
You’re actin’ like a real fool
Now it’s time for you to change your act
Or else I’ll leave you and never be back
I’m the one who’ll lead you through the night
I’ll keep you warm when winter bites
I’m not a girl who likes to sit and chat
I never did like that
Come on, honey, and let’s go crazy
Try and hack it and be my baby
You better flip out and take your chance, babe
Let me lead the way
Come on, honey, and let’s go crazy
Try and hack it and be my baby
You better flip out and take your chance, babe
Let me lead the way
Don’t pretend to be Mister Cool
You’re actin’ like a real fool
Now it’s time for you to change your act
Or else I’ll leave you and never be back
If you can’t change, honey, I don’t care
You don’t have the guts to take my dare
I’m not a girl you can satisfy
Oh buddy, have a try
Come on, honey, and let’s go crazy
Try and hack it and be my baby
You better flip out and take your chance, babe
Let me lead the way
Come on, honey, and let’s go crazy
Try and hack it and be my baby
You better flip out and take your chance, babe
I’m gonna lead the way
Come on, honey, and let’s go crazy
Try and hack it and be my baby
You better flip out and take your chance, babe
Let me lead the way
Come on, honey, and let’s go crazy
Try and hack it and be my baby
You better flip out and take your chance, babe
I’m gonna lead the way
Dulce Pontes – Lusitana paixão (Portugal 1991)
Fado… to cry the sadness well
Fado… to fall asleep with the pain
Fado… only when the longing comes
Forcing out of my past
A great love

But… I do not condemn this passion
This pain of the words
That the guitar is also moaning
I do not, I will not ask for forgiveness
When enjoying sin
And to come back to give me
Because I want to be happy
And the misfortune is not spoken
I do not want what the fado wants to say.

Fado… to sob memories
Fado… to revive such a pain
Fado… only when the longing comes
Forcing out of my past a great love

But, I do not condemn this passion
The pain of the words
That the guitar is also moaning
I do not, I will not ask for forgiveness
When enjoying sin
And to come back to give me
I know that aspect that is in us
Soulful Lusitanian
As the legend of Severa
Because I want to be happy
And the misfortune is not spoken
The fado does not make me repent.

Simone de Oliveira – Desfolhada portuguesa (Portugal 1969)

Body of line, lips of must
My handsome body, my lit fire
Threshing-floor of corn, moonlight of August
Who bears a child, does it out of love

It is corn-king, red corn
Clove of meat, little grape of love
Son of a king who being old
Returns to be born when there is heat

My spoken word to the nascent sunlight
My madrigal of dawn
Love, love, love, love, love present
In each defoliated ear

My root of green pine
My blue sky touching the mountain range
Oh my heartache and my thirst
Oh sea to the south of my land

It is blonde wheat, it is beyond Tagus
My country in this movement
The sun burns it, the wind kisses it
It will harvest crazily in movement

My spoken word to the nascent sunlight
My madrigal of dawn
Love, love, love, love, love present
In each defoliated ear

Eyes of almond, dark cistern
Where the misadventure is covered with porch
Hidden fury, enchanted fury
Lost legend, found legend

Oh my land, my adventure
Helpless shell of us
Oh my land, my faraway place
For me lost, for me found

Lúcia Moniz – O meu coração não tem cor (Portugal 1996)
"We are all moving around the old circle"
Singing in this sweet and salty language.
What is far is near in the songs
Which make a party between three continents.

We dance samba and marrabenta too,
We cry the fado and play the coladeira
The door is always open to welcome everyone.
If one is tired, says goodbye to tiredness

Corridinho started to run,
A well-performed and hopping dance.
Just play the funaná and the malhão vigorously
And we will dance together, without getting confused,
In the offbeat pace of this heart.

Come on, come on, come on,
Let's make a circle and dance!

We are on the mood, let's dance.
Come on, mix your flavour with mine.
Let this song sail away
Because my heart is colourless.

We are on the mood, let's dance.
Come on, mix your flavour with mine.
Let this song sail away
Because my heart is colourless.

We are always dancing,
Our bodies swing with sweet and slow moves.
In our mouths there is a tumultuous saudade
for fig, papaya and guaraná

Vira started to turn and merengue too,
We cry the morna and play the sapateia
The door is always open to welcome everyone
Because we like when our house is full of people.

Let's dance the bailinho
Bring the sanfona and the cavaquinho
Chula will be danced and the baião too
And we will dance together, without getting confused,
In the offbeat pace of this heart.

Come on, come on, come on,
Let's make a circle and dance!

We are on the mood, let's dance.
Come on, mix your flavour with mine.
Let this song sail away
Because my heart is colourless.

We are on the mood, let's dance.
Come on, mix your flavour with mine.
Let this song sail away
Because my heart is colourless.

Hey!
(And turn around, and turn around to the end)
Because my heart is colourless.

Bobbysocks! – La det swinge (Norway 1985)
From a radio old melodies flow
And I wake up and ask myself what's going on
Is this only dream and fantasies
When I feel that it's swinging more and more?

Let it swing, let it rock 'n' roll
Let it swing until you lose all control
Oh hi ho...
Let it swing, let it rock 'n' roll

Let the music live, never let the rhythm stop
Can you feel that you're alive right here and now?
Do you feel how much you want to dance?
Oh... and do you hear your heart beating on and on?

Let it swing, let it rock 'n' roll
Let it swing until you lose all control
Oh hi ho...
Let it swing, let it rock 'n' roll

Do you feel how much you want to dance?
Do you hear your heart beating on and on
And on?

Let it swing, let it rock 'n' roll
Let it swing until you lose all control
Oh hi ho...
Let it swing, let it rock 'n' roll

Let it swing, let it rock 'n' roll
Let it swing until you lose all control
Oh hi oh...
Let it swing, let it rock 'n'
Swing, let it roll 'n'
Swing, let it rock 'n' roll

"Refrain" - Lys Assia
Love chorus, oh oh oh oh
Chorus, sky colour, fragrance of my twenties
Sunny garden where I would run as a child
I've been looking for you everywhere, my far lover
Watching by the tracks where you would take my hand

Days went away and we've grown up
Love hurt us, time healed us
But alone and with no spring
I'm running in vain in the woods, the fields
Hey, remember our past loves

Years go by swiftly
And on the roofs of boredom, drips the rain
Where did the caravels go
Stealing my heart, carrying my dreams towards your oblivion?
I wish you came back like in yesteryear
(And) bring me flowers to my window shutter
And your youth to my lodge

Chorus, rain colour, regrets of my twenties
Sorrow, melancholy of not being a child anymore
But alone and far from you, through the paths where you're not
I go, weeping for my twenties' loves

"Net als toen" - Corry Brokken (1957, Netherlands)
Don’t be so drowsy with that eternal paper
Don’t yawn from sleep or boredom
I’m your wife and I eat out of your hand
But I don’t eat from charity

Don’t look at me as if you think, “are you still alive?”
Am I still that woman
With whom you once – when was it again?
Wanted to have that little adventure at all costs?

Be nice once again, just like then
Ask me once again for a kiss
Bring me roses again, blush again
When you see me, just like then

Be nice and gallant once again
Find me beautiful and charming again
Then the world will be just like before
A fairyland

Yes, you’re getting fat and your hair is turning grey
But you still can flirt, believe me
Ah, sometimes you act like a child, so silly
Gruff and wanton by turn

Do you remember? Do you remember? Don’t say no now
Do you remember, that you said then?
The happiest couple, that’s the both of us
My love, dearest darling, never ends

Be nice once again, just like then
Ask me once again for a kiss
Bring me roses again, blush again
When you see me, just like then
 Be nice and gallant once again
Find me beautiful and charming again
Then the world will be just like before
A fairyland

"Dors, mon amour" - André Claveau (France 1958)
Sleep, my love
The sun is still far from the day
We have all the time to love
And the night understands us

Sleep, my love
Protected by my arms that surround
Your sleep with a curtain of happiness
Sleep onto my heart

I'm a king
That holds his kingdom in his fingers
And that shivers of sight
This enchanted kingdom

Sleep, my love
My princess, locked up in her tower
With all the refrains of the night
My sleepy princess
I'm following your soul step by step
And I am enjoying myself by leaning over your starry sleep

Sleep, my love
The sun is still far from the day
We have all the time to love
And the night understands us

Sleep, my love
Protected by my arms that surround
Your sleep with a curtain of happiness
Sleep onto my heart

I hear the voice
Of your life that beats so close to me
And I feel like a very gentle blow
That caresses my cheek

Sleep, my love
My princess, locked up in her tower
I see the morning smile
Here's the sun of tomorrow
The great sun of the eternal love
"Een beetje" - Teddy Scholten (Netherlands 1959)
I wanted your heart to be a closet with a little door
And that I could look in the little interior
Then you had to be sincere, good or bad, but true
And then you'd soon say, when I asked: "Are you faithful?"

A bit, everyone is in love at least once, you know that
You want to be sensible, but you forget that
As soon as you listen to what Amor whispers
Then you know, it will be something like Faust and Gretchen
With little rendezvous in a little café
And strolling in the moonshine

With the smell of roses
And kissing goodbye at the door
The night is blue, you whisper mouth to mouth
I swear eternal allegiance to you

A bit, you were in love more than once, mister, you know that
Your heart came up with a little idea more than once
You were sorry, but ah you know, sometimes you forget
Maybe a bit too soon, your little oath of loyalty

But actually, I'm happy that my heart has no door either
Because you never know what may live there in the interior
I'm willing to promise, when we get engaged
And you ask: "Are you faithful?", I'll never say to you...

With the smell of roses
And kissing goodbye at the door
The night is blue, you whisper mouth to mouth
I swear eternal allegiance to you

A bit, you were in love more than once, mister, you know that
Your heart came up with a little idea more than once
You were sorry, but ah you know, sometimes you forget
Maybe a bit too soon, your little oath of loyalty

"Tom Pillibi" - Jacqueline Boyer (France 1960)
Tom Pillibi is quite a guy
Perfectly sweet and charming
Tom Pillibi is rather shy
That’s when he’s so alarming

In all my dreams I never thought
That he will be romantic
But when it seems this girl got caught
By little Tommy’s antics

He’s quite a lover, Tom Pillibi
As I discovered when he went out with me
So with a lover, as with a book
Don’t trust the cover, or you might well be hooked

Tom Pillibi may well appear
To be a little nervy
‘Specially if you should find him there
Someone, well, sweet and curvy

Although he’s longing for a date
He’ll say he wants in trying
But here and now I’d like to state
Tom Pillibi is lying

He’s quite a lover, Tom Pillibi
As I discovered when he went out with me
So with a lover, as with a book
Don’t trust the cover, or you might well be hooked

Tom Pillibi has big blue eyes
And when you see him smiling
That’s when you start to realise
His smile is quite beguiling

Now that I’ve told you all I know
You’ll never have to worry
For with a rather clever boy
Better be safe than sorry

He’s quite a lover, Tom Pillibi
As I discovered when he went out with me
So with a lover, as with a book
Don’t trust the cover, or you might will be hooked

"Nous les amoureux" - Jean-Claude Pascal (1961, France)
We, the lovers – they want to separate us
They would like to prevent us from being happy
We, the lovers – it seems that it’s hell
That watches us or else the iron and the fire
It’s true, the idiots and the evil ones
Harm us, do bad things to us
However nothing is more obvious than love
We, the lovers, we can do nothing against them
They are a thousand and we are two, the lovers

But the hour is going to ring on the least difficult nights
And I could love you without them talking about it downtown
It’s promised, it’s written down

We, the lovers – the sun shines for us
And we sleep on the knees of the Good Lord
We, the lovers – He gave us the right
To be happy and to be joyful together

Then, the without-loves, the mis-loved
It will be necessary that we pay back
Those who have never been condemned
We, the lovers, we’re going to live without you
For the sky is with us, the lovers

"Un premier amour" - Isabelle Aubret (France 1962)
A first love, first love, first love
Is never forgotten, never forgotten, never forgotten
A first love, we always look for it
In other loves, we pursue it our whole life

It confused us and made us dream and made us tremble
This first love, first love, first love
But the child that we are, the child that we remained
Will always hum in memory of this love

And you, you that I loved
What did you make of yourself?
What did you do without me?
And me, me who lost you
What have I done more?
Was I so much more lucky?
Did we actually know.....
 A first love, first love, first love
Is never forgotten, never forgotten, never forgotten
A first love, we always look for it
In other loves, we pursue it our whole life

That all these kisses that we have stolen rather than given
These innocent gestures engaged us for so long
No, the children we still were back then
Didn't suspect much, they were delighted
That a first love, their first love was so strong

"Merci, Chérie" - Udo Jürgens (Austria 1966)
Thank you, thank you, thank you
You, the love of my life – thank you, darling
For the hours of past happiness – thank you, darling
For the days and the nights we won’t forget
Farewell, farewell, farewell
I have tears in my eyes, I have to leave
I know that everything will end – thank you, darling
For all the pleasure you gave me

The important moment has come today
To choose the turning point of my life
I have to go, I have to leave you
The wounded, wounded heart
 Thank you, thank you, thank you
You, the love of my life – thank you, darling
For all the pleasure you gave me – thank you, darling
Farewell, darling, thank you, darling
Farewell, darling, thank you, darling
Thank you

"Puppet on a String" - Sandie Shaw (1967, UK)
I wonder if one day that,
You'll say that, you care
If you say you love me madly,
I'll gladly, be there
Like a puppet on a string
Love is just like a merry-go-round
With all the fun of the fair
One day I'm feeling down on the ground
Then I'm up in the air
Are you leading me on?
Tomorrow will you be gone?
I wonder if one day that,
You'll say that, you care
If you love me madly,
I'll gladly, be there
Like a puppet on a string
I may win on the roundabout
Then I'll lose on the swings
In or out, there is never a doubt
Just who's pulling the strings
I'm all tied up to you
But where's it leading me to?
I wonder if one day that,
You'll say that, you care
If you say you love me madly,
I'll gladly, be there
Like a puppet on a string
I wonder if one day that,
You'll say that, you care
If you say you love me madly,
I'll gladly, be there
Like a puppet on a string
Like a puppet on a, string
"La, la, la" - Massiel (Spain, 1968)
I remember, mother, how you'd take me by the hand
You were still young and I was already growing up
We were cold but, with a single song,
You made my nights clearer and the Autumn sky, bluer

La lalala lalala lalala…
La lalala lalala la…
La lalala lalala lalala…
La lalala lalala la…

I remember, mother, when you made me sing
Traverse all the borders, look afar and keep going forward
Nothing can erase it, and I refuse to forget it
And for you, mother, they hear me sing each evening...

La lalala lalala lalala…
La lalala lalala la…
La lalala lalala lalala…
La lalala lalala la…

La lalala lalala lalala…
La lalala lalala la…
La lalala lalala lalala…
La lalala lalala la…

"Vivo cantando" - Salomé (1969, Spain)
How many nights I wandered
Through a thousand endless paths?
How many nights I kept silent
About what I wanted to say?
A deep hope
And a faraway echo was talking about you

Today that you came to my life
I only sing for you

Since you arrived, I don't live by crying
I live by singing, I live by dreaming
I just want you to tell me what's happening
Because I'm trembling when I'm by your side

Since you arrived, I don't live by crying (hey)
I live by singing (hey), I live by dreaming (hey)
But I wonder how long I could keep
Your love deep inside of me

Since you arrived, I don't live by crying (hey)
I live by singing (hey), I live by dreaming (hey)
I just want you to tell me what's happening
Because I'm trembling when I'm by your side

Since you arrived, I don't live by crying (hey)
I live by singing (hey), I live by dreaming (hey)
But I wonder how long I could keep
Your love deep inside of me

Since you arrived, I don't live by crying (hey)
I live by singing (hey), I live by dreaming (hey)
I just want you to tell me what's happening
Because I'm trembling when I'm by your side
Because I'm trembling when I'm by your side

"Boom Bang-a-Bang" - Lulu (1969, UK)
Come closer, come closer and listen;
the beat of my heart keeps on missing.
I notice it most when we're kissing.
Come closer and love me tonight.
That's right!
Come closer and cuddle me tight.

My heart goes;
boom bang-a-bang, boom bang-a-bang
when you are near.
Boom bang-a-bang, boom bang-a-bang
loud in my ear.
Pounding away, pounding away,
won't you be mine?
Boom bang-a-bang-bang all the time.

It's such a lovely feeling
when I'm in your arms.
Don't go away,
I wanna stay my whole life through,
boom bang-a-bang-bang,
close to you.

Your smile is so warm and inviting.
The thought of your kiss is exciting.
So hold me and don't keep me waiting.
Come closer and love me tonight.
That's right!
Come closer and cuddle me tight.

My heart goes;
boom bang-a-bang, boom bang-a-bang
when you are near.
Boom bang-a-bang, boom bang-a-bang
loud in my ear.
Pounding away, pounding away,
won't you be mine?
Boom bang-a-bang-bang all the time.

It's such a lovely feeling
when I'm in your arms.
Now you are near
I wanna hear your heartbeat too.
Boom bang-a-bang-bang,
I love you.

It's such a lovely feeling
when I'm in your arms.
Now you are near
I wanna hear your heartbeat too.
Boom bang-a-bang-bang...
Boom bang-a-bang-bang...
Boom bang-a-bang-bang,
I love you.

"De troubadour" - Lenny Kuhr (1969, Netherlands)
He was so full of music,
He sang for big and small audiences,
He made you happy, melancholy,
The troubadour

For knights in the high hall,
He sang in though, strong language,
A long and bloody story,
The troubadour

But also the workers from the shed,
Heard his song of adventure,
Belonged to the nightly kitchen fire,
The troubadour, the troubadour

And at the inn of the city,
He sang a drinking song in the wet,
For who still could stand and who sat,
The troubadour, the troubadour

He sang his song quiet in the monastry,
Of a miracle that happened,
Even if no one sees the miracle,
The troubadour

Of women in velvet or in gray,
He made the hearts confused,
His love song went along for the trip,
The troubadour

He sang for farmes on the land,
A dude song of his own,
He was in every walk of life,
The troubadour, the troubadour

So he sang for all his life,
His own song, his own voice,
Yet the death goes his own way,
The troubadour, the troubadour

Then it became quiet, the song was over,
Only some mud remains,
But who was comforted by his song,
Will remember him,

Cause he was so full of music,
He sang for large and small audiences,
He made you happy, melancholy,
The troubadour

"All Kinds of Everything" - Dana (1970, Ireland)
Snowdrops and daffodils
Butterflies and bees
Sailboats and fishermen
Things of the sea
Wishing-wells
Wedding bells
Early morning dew
All kinds of everything remind me of you
Seagulls and aeroplanes
Things of the sky
Winds that go howlin'
Breezes that sigh
City sights
Neon lights
Grey skies or blue
All kinds of everything remind me of you
Summertime
Wintertime
Spring and autumn too
Monday
Tuesday every day
I think of you.
Dances
Romances
Things of the night
Sunshine and holidays
Postcards to write
Budding trees
Autumn leaves
A snowflake or two
All kinds of everything remind me of you.
Summertime
Wintertime
Spring and autumn too
Seasons will never change
The way that I love you.
Dances
Romances
Things of the night
Sunshine and holidays
Postcards to write
Budding trees
Autumn leaves
A snowflake or two
All kinds of everything remind me of you.
All kinds of everything remind me of you.

"Ding-a-dong" - Teach-In”
When you're feeling all right
Everything is uptight
Try to sing a song that goes ding-ding-a-dong
There will be no sorrow
When you sing tomorrow
And you walk along with your ding-dang-dong
Dinge-dong
Every hour
When you pick a flower
Even when your lover is gone, gone, gone
Dinge-dong
Listen to it
Maybe it's a big hit
Even when your lover is gone, gone, gone
Sing ding-ding-dong
When you're feeling all right
Everything is uptight
Listen to a song that goes ding-ding-a-dong
And the world looks sunny
Everyone is funny
When they sing a song that goes ding-dang-dong
Dinge-dong
Every hour
When you pick a flower
Even when your lover is gone, gone, gone
Dinge-dong
Listen to it
Maybe it's a big hit
Even when your lover is gone, gone, gone
Sing ding-ding-dong
Ding dang dong
Dinge…

"A-Ba-Ni-Bi" - Izhar Cohen and the Alphabeta (israel)
Oh, when I was a little child
My days were happy, free and wild
But when in love, I couldn't say
The words I wanna say today
Those words were always spinning in my head
I used to whisper them at night in bed
And when alone, I didn't try to hide
Those magic words I heard inside
Love is God, love is all around
It's a lovely sound, lost and found
Love is free, love's been good to me
I'm in love with the fact
That the language of love is alive

"What's Another Year" - Johnny Logan
I've been waiting such a long time,
looking out for you
But you're not here
What's another year?
I've been waking such a long time,
reaching out for you
But you're not near
What's another year?
to someone who's lost everything that he owns?
to someone who's getting used to being alone?
I've been praying such a long time
It's the only way to hide the fear
What's another year?
to someone who's lost everything that he owns?
to someone who's getting used to being alone?
I've been crying such a long time
With such a lot of pain in every tear
What's another year?
to someone who is getting used to being alone
What's another year?
For someone who is getting used to being alone
What's another year?
to someone who is getting used to being alone

"Si la vie est cadeau" - Corinne Hermès
Us, it was all blue
A summer sky, a transparent ocean
We, we were two
and we loved each other strong enough to stop time

But time has cheated on us
So, why having promised me the entire world?
Our love would have been enough
I didn't want imaginary happiness
If life is a gift

If life is a gift
Given present, taken back gift, stolen present
Take love as a gift
Given present, taken back gift, stolen present
Happiness is too short

Us, it was the child I wanted badly
To offer you in Spring

But time has got all the rights
So, why having promised me the entire world?
And the child that is not there?
Now it is my only imaginary happiness
If life is a gift

If life is a gift
Given present, taken back gift, stolen present
Take love as a gift
Given present, taken back gift, stolen present
Happiness is too short

"Diggi-Loo Diggi-Ley" - Herreys (Sweden 1984)

Lightning and thunder, magic and wonder
I don't know how, but it did happen to me
(You felt your heart was set free)

What a sensation, (you're flying up high now)
Sweet inspiration, (you're going to the sky now)
Couldn't believe I was dreamin'
Couldn't believe it was true

Diggi-loo diggi-ley, life is goin' my way
When I'm walkin' in my golden shoes
Everything I ever dreamed of has suddenly come true

Diggi-loo diggi-ley, let this miracle stay
I could be whatever I would choose
Please don't wake me up
I'm dreamin' of me in golden shoes

Golden reflections givin' directions
Bringin' the best that I have right out of me
(How in the world could this be?)

Knowing' your senses, (what burning desire)
Climbin' the fences, (it's taking you up higher)
Now I believe I can make it
Oh... what a wonderful world

Diggi-loo diggi-ley, life is goin' my way
When I'm walkin' in my golden shoes
Everything I ever dreamed of has suddenly come true

Diggi-loo diggi-ley, let this miracle stay
I could be whatever I would choose
Please don't wake me up
I'm dreamin' of me in golden shoes

I know my dream was a fantasy illusion
But when I woke up, I came to the conclusion
I can be what I want to
Oh... oh...

Diggi-loo diggi-ley, let this miracle stay
I could be whatever I would choose
Please don't wake me up
I'm dreamin' of me in golden shoes

Please don't wake me up
I'm dreamin' of me in golden shoes

"La det swinge" - Bobbysocks! (Norway 1984)
From a radio old melodies flow
And I wake up and ask myself what's going on
Is this only dream and fantasies
When I feel that it's swinging more and more?

Let it swing, let it rock 'n' roll
Let it swing until you lose all control
Oh hi ho...
Let it swing, let it rock 'n' roll

Let the music live, never let the rhythm stop
Can you feel that you're alive right here and now?
Do you feel how much you want to dance?
Oh... and do you hear your heart beating on and on?

Let it swing, let it rock 'n' roll
Let it swing until you lose all control
Oh hi ho...
Let it swing, let it rock 'n' roll

Do you feel how much you want to dance?
Do you hear your heart beating on and on
And on?

Let it swing, let it rock 'n' roll
Let it swing until you lose all control
Oh hi ho...
Let it swing, let it rock 'n' roll

Let it swing, let it rock 'n' roll
Let it swing until you lose all control
Oh hi oh...
Let it swing, let it rock 'n'
Swing, let it roll 'n'
Swing, let it rock 'n' roll
"Rock Me" - Riva (Yugoslavia 1989)
Oh… whoa oh oh oh…
It happened once upon a time, the son of the mayor
Invited me to listen to a great piano player
He sure was trying to impress me, but that was not the way to bless me
He didn’t know my feet were made for dancin’
Whoa oh oh oh…
Rock me, baby, c’mon, feel the sound
Rock me, baby, hardly touch the ground
Rock me, baby, ’cause our feet were made to dance
Whoa oh oh oh…
Rock me, baby, c’mon, feel the sound
Rock me, baby, up and down around
Rock me, baby, ’cause our feet were made to dance
It happened once and never again, the son of the mayor
Invited me to listen to a great piano player
His eyes were lovin’ all the glory, but different people, different story
He couldn’t see my feet were made for dancin’
Whoa oh oh oh…
Rock me, baby, c’mon, feel the sound
Rock me, baby, hardly touch the ground
Rock me, baby, ’cause our feet were made to dance
Whoa oh oh oh…

Whoa oh oh oh… dance

"Why Me?" - Linda Martin (1992 Ireland)
Sometimes I watch you passing by my window
And sometimes I watch you passing through my dreams
And sometimes, when I look at you
You take my breath away

Sometimes I try and understand your reasons
You choose to feel the way you feel about me
And sometimes, when I turn around
And you're there, like today
I wanna say:

Why me?
I look at you and I get to feeling
Why me? (Why me, whooh)
I know it's true but I can't believe it
I keep on wondering why
My love shines in your eyes
Why me?
I look at you and I ask myself
Why me?

Sometimes I lie awake and watch you sleeping
And listen to the beating of your heart
And sometimes, when you're lying there
You take my breath away
And I wanna say

Why me?
I look at you and I get to feeling
Why me? (Why me, whooh)
I know it's true but I can't believe that it's me
Who's gonna be holdin' you in my arms tonight
And why it's me
Who's gonna be the one to make you feel all right
Tonight

Why me?
I look at you and I get to feeling
Why me? (Why me, whooh)
I know it's true but I can't believe it
I keep on wondering why
My love shines in your eyes
Why me?
I look at you and I ask myself
Why me?

"I Wanna" - Marie N (Latvia 2002)
I like go away, but it's easier to say
That you know all the tricks that make me stay
I'm ready to support this artful game you always play
'Cause you don't know the fee which you will later, later pay
Today you think you are the winner
Today you think you are the king
You make me sweat in my emotions
Under your fly-away, fly-away wing

I wanna be the sunshine in your arms
I wanna be the light from shooting stars
I wanna be the queen in your sweet lies
I wanna be the love spark in your eyes

I like a simple game, but it's just easier to say
That you own all that rules your crazy, crazy way
And even though you'll go like to do whatever, whatever you may
Just remember it's me who finds you when, when you stray
Today you think you are the winner
Today you think you are the king
You make me sweat in my emotions
Under your fly-away, fly-away wing

I wanna be the sunshine in your arms
I wanna be the light from shooting stars
I wanna be the queen in your sweet lies
I wanna be the love spark in your eyes

"Running Scared" - Ell & Nikki (2011 Azerbaijan)
Come to me, come to me tonight
God, I need you, anyway
Baby, I just wanna be, be around you all the time
God, I need you, oh

I'm running, I'm scared tonight
I'm running, I'm scared of life
I'm running, I'm scared of breathing
'Cause I adore you
I'm running, I'm scared tonight
I'm running, I'm scared of breathing
'Cause I adore you

Come to me, come to me a bit more
God, I need you
There's nothing left for me to say
So rest on me, darling
Stay forever more
God, I need you, I need you

I'm running, I'm scared tonight
I'm running, I'm scared of life
I'm running, I'm scared of breathing
'Cause I adore you
I'm running, I'm scared tonight
I'm running, I'm scared of breathing
'Cause I adore you

What I wouldn't give away
To be your shelter and keep you safe
Keep you safe
Keep you safe

I'm running, I'm scared tonight
I'm running, I'm scared of life
I'm running, I'm scared of breathing
'Cause I adore you
I'm running, I'm scared tonight
I'm running, I'm scared of breathing
'Cause I adore you

And I'm running
And I'm running scared
'Cause I adore you

Hovi Star – Made of Stars (Israel 2016)
A language I don’t understand
You speak, I listen, I’m your friend
(You hypnotise me)
Take my hand
A million faces tied in chains
You ride a black horse in the rain
(You hypnotise me)
Don’t escape
No more, no more, no more, no more
‘Cause we are all
Made of stars
Silver fragments falling
We are made of stars
We are made of stars
Searching for that secret promise
Made of stars
You heal me, you fill me
Ignite a flame within me
(You hypnotise me) Mmm…
I’m begging you, don’t escape
No more, no more, no more, no more
‘Cause we are all
Made of stars
Silver fragments falling
We are made of stars
We are made of stars
Searching for that secret promise
Made of stars
Tell me that you understand
Come in close and take my hand
Let’s float across the sky line
There’s no floor and there’s no ceiling
Dance with me like we are made of stars
‘Cause we are (‘Cause we are)
‘Cause we are (‘Cause we are)
We are, we are, we are
Dance with me like we are made of stars
Dance with me like we are made of stars
Made of stars
Silver fragments falling
We are made of stars
We are made of stars
Searching for that secret promise
Made of stars
Dance with me like we are made of stars
Dance with me like we are made of stars

Avi Toledano - Hora (Israel 1982)
The field we left behind then, still turns golden
The earth still bears its crop
And still beautiful are the nights in Canaan
Before the sun rises

The train still crosses the green orchard there
A stork still rests above
And the fog still floats in the valley
Between the sunrise and the dew

And also the hora, the one with the “Hey!”
Its voice still rises, its voice is not stilled
And this hora, the one with the “Hey!”
Its song fills my heart forever

Clouds still float over the city's houses
And the sea caresses the shore
And it's still heard, how within everyone's heart
An old song and a dance are beating

Izhar Cohen "Olé, Olé" (1985 - Israel)
Light and azure are in the sky
and suddenly the day appears
Clouds turn to water,
a rainbow rises in the sky

A variety of shades and a light of the sky
that colour the world
And it's many times more beautiful,
and it makes everyone smile

Going up! We'll sing together
When the joy blossoms in the heart
Going up! We ll sing together
Great and small, like a rainbow in the clouds

Wanting to come closer to each other,
asking to dream together
Designing a rainbow to one another,
a thousand colours for peace

So we come and sing tonight
from the four corners of the world
The joy in the heart is not enough,
a moment of light for everyone

Going up! We'll sing together
When the joy blossoms in the heart
Going up! We ll sing together
Great and small, like a rainbow in the clouds

And the song strengthens in the meantime,
bringing the hearts together
Angels spread their wings
and the candles are lit

Going up! We'll sing together
When the joy blossoms in the heart
Going up! We ll sing together
Great and small, like a rainbow in the clouds

Na na na na, na na na na na bobb
Na na na na na
Going up! We ll sing together
Great and small, like a rainbow in the clouds
Like a rainbow in the clouds,
like a rainbow in the clouds.

Dschinghis Khan – ‘Genghis Khan’ (1979 - Germany)
Hu, ha, hu, ha... hu, ha, hu, ha...
Hu, ha, hu, ha... hu, ha, hu, ha...
Hu, ha, hu, ha, hu, ha, hu, ha...

They rode the fastest horses
Left the wind behind
Thousand men
Ha, hu, ha...
And one man led the way
The others followed by:
Genghis Khan
Ha, hu, ha...

They galloped over mountains and desert-sands
They carried desolation throughout the land
And nothing there could stop them in this world
Hu, ha...

Gen... Gen... Genghis Khan
Hey, rider; ho, rider; go, rider
Let us follow
Gen... Gen... Genghis Khan
Hey, brother; ho, brother; hey, brother
Hear us holler

Who cares where we're going
Ho, ho, ho, ho...
There's no way of knowing
Ha, ha, ha, ha...
And we'll let the Devil take our souls

Gen... Gen... Genghis Khan
Hey, rider; ho, rider; go, rider
Let us follow
Gen... Gen... Genghis Khan
Go, brother; dream, brother; dance, brother
Hear us holler

You can hear his laughter
Ho, ho, ho, ho...
Now and ever-after
Ha, ha, ha, ha...
When he lifts his glass up in the air

He was the greatest lover
And the strongest man
Of his day
Ha, hu, ha...
And we have heard that
All the women fell for him
So they say
Ha, hu, ha...

And he bred seven children in one whole night
He had his girls around him at his very sight
And nothing that could stop him in this world
Hu, ha...

Maggie McNeal – Amsterdam (1980)
Wherever you are in the world
You think back to that moment
And you don’t know where you know it from

But all of sudden you remember again
There was a superb atmosphere
And it’s there time and again

In Amsterdam, Amsterdam
All kinds of things are going on
Amsterdam, Amsterdam
Exists for centuries already

Amsterdam, Amsterdam
The city where everything’s possible
Amsterdam, Amsterdam
Everyone knows about it

Here you’re really never alone
You find a part of everyone
In everything around you

Here, all people feel happy
And free in their comings and goings
With the feeling of belonging

In Amsterdam, Amsterdam
All kinds of things are going on
Amsterdam, Amsterdam
Exists for centuries already

In that city
Where the whole wide world greets you
You’ll find everything you’re looking for
Everywhere in plenty

Amsterdam, Amsterdam
All kinds of things are going on there
Amsterdam, Amsterdam
Exists for centuries already

Amsterdam
The city where everything’s possible
Amsterdam, Amsterdam
Everyone knows about it

Naviband – Historyja majho žycci (Belarus 2017)
How many days, how many dates
New images and towns
The chain of events falls behind us
We keep it in our hearts and move on
The story of my life
Will shine brighter
The sun will sparkle in our blood
all the beauty of your eyes
I will seek you out wherever you may be
To discover the bright moments quicker
Today will give birth
To new desires and better ideas
The story of my life
Will shine brighter
The sun will sparkle in our blood
all the beauty of your eyes

"Are You Sure?" - The Allisons 1961
Goodbye (goodbye)
Farewell (farewell)
I'm not sure what to do
So long (so long)
Au revoir (au revoir)
It's hard, but I'll pull through
Are you sure you won't be sorry?
Comes tomorrow, you won't want me
Back again to hold you tightly?
Now are you sure
It's not your foolish heart?
That you won't grieve
If we're to be apart?
You will see as time goes by
We'll grow lonely
You and I
Dreaming of each other and we'll cry
Goodbye (goodbye)
Farewell (farewell)
I'm not sure what to do
So long (so long)
Au revoir (au revoir)
It's hard, but I'll pull through
Are you sure you won't be sorry?
Comes tomorrow, you won't want me
Back again to hold you tightly?
Just stop and think
It's your decision now
For you're the one
Who went and broke the vow
You'll be sorry
Wait and see
Spend your life in misery
Wishing that you had returned to me
Goodbye (goodbye)
Farewell (farewell)
What is there to live for?
Before you go
Just think now are you sure?
Are you sure you won't be sorry?
Comes tomorrow, you won't want me
Back again to hold you tightly in my arms?

 'Angel' by Chiara - Malta (2005)
Far away
In a lost world
I hear your voice
Calling for heaven

Cast away
Caught in mem’ries
You must believe
Love will come through

I’ll be your angel
In your darkest night
I’ll be your destiny
Waiting by your side
I’ll be the sunshine
When you’re feeling blue
I’m always here
For you

Comes a day
Heart on fire
When all your faith
Seems to be missing
Go your way
And you’ll find there
A land of hope
A land of dreams

I’ll be your angel
In your darkest night
I’ll be your destiny
Waiting by your side
I’ll be the sunshine
When you’re feeling blue
I’m always here
For you

And when you loose it all
And nothing seems right
Just keep holding on
To me

I’ll be your angel
In your darkest night
I’ll be your destiny
Waiting by your side
I’ll be the sunshine
When you’re feeling blue
I’m always here
For you
"Better the Devil you Know" - Sonia

Better The Devil You Know
It's better the devil, devil, yeah, yeah, yeah
It's better the devil, devil, yeah, yeah, yeah

Baby, don't do things that make me blue
You know my love is always true
Baby, don't do things that make me cry
I just can't seem to sleep at night

You know I love him every day
It breaks my heart when he goes away

Better the devil you know than the devil you don't
I'll give you my heart and my soul if you give me your love
Better the devil you know than the devil you don't

I tell him that I love him most every day
I'm out of my head, I don't know what to say
He never plays around like the other guys do
He's got the key to my heart and my love is true

You know I love him every day
It breaks my heart when he goes away

Better the devil you know than the devil you don't
I'll give you my heart and my soul if you give me your love

Oh no, don't tell me lies boy
Oh no, don't make me cry
Oh no, don't tell me lies boy
Oh no, don't say goodbye

Better the devil, better the devil

You know I love him every day
It breaks my heart when he goes away, when he goes away

Better the devil you know than the devil you don't
I'll give you my heart and my soul if you give me your love

Better the devil you know than the devil you don't
I'll give you my heart and my soul if you give me your love
Better the devil, better the devil

Better the devil you know than the devil you don't
I'll give you my heart and my soul if you give me your love
I'll give you my heart, oh baby

Abba - Ring Ring
I was sitting by the phone
I was waiting all alone
Baby by myself I sit and wait and wonder about you
It's a dark and dreary night
Seems like nothing's going right
Won't you tell me honey how can I go on here without you?
Yes I'm down and feeling blue
And I don't know what to do, oh-oh
Ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
Ring, ring, the happiest sound of them all
Ring, ring, I stare at the phone on the wall
And I sit all alone impatiently
Won't you please understand the need in me
So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
You were here and now you're gone
Hey did I do something wrong?
I just can't believe that I could be so badly mistaken
Was it me or was it you?
Tell me, are we really through?
Won't you hear me cry and you will know that my heart is breaking
Please forgive and then forget
Or maybe darling better yet, oh-oh
Ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
Ring, ring, the happiest sound of them all
Ring, ring, I stare at the phone on the wall
And I sit all alone impatiently
Won't you please understand the need in me
So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
Oh-oh, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?


Pearl Carr And Teddy Johnson — Sing, Little Birdie
Sing, sing, sing, little birdie
Sing, sing, sing it

There's a bird on a branch
There's a branch on a tree
There's a tree in the meadow
And that's where I long to be

'Neath that bird on a branch
'Neath that branch on a tree
'Neath that tree in the meadow
Where you said you love me

Sing, little birdie, sing your song
Sing, you'll help our love along
Sing, little birdie up above
Sing a song of love

There's a bird on a branch
There's a branch on a tree
Where we carved our initials
There for all the world to see

'Neath that bird on a branch
'Neath that branch on a tree
Where we promised our true love
For all eternity

Sing, little birdie, sing your song
Sing, you'll help our love along
Sing, little birdie up above
Sing a song of love

When the years pass on by
And we're wed, you and I
And the bluebirds are singing
Their sweet love songs in the sky

We will dream of that bird
On a branch, on a tree
And that tree in the meadow
Where you said you love me

Sing, little birdie, sing your song
Sing, you'll help our love along
Sing, little birdie up above
Sing a song of love

Sing, little birdie, sing your song
Sing, you'll help our love along

Michael Ball — One Step Out Of Time 1992
Don't walk away
Just let your heart decide
If love is gonna stay
I know it's right
Just think about it, girl
Ooh for a while
Another week
Another day
When I call
You're miles away
In the arms
Of another
All my friends say
I'm crazy
Night after night
I'm waiting
Say that I'm wrong
Then you tell me
That I'm coming on too strong
One step out of time
One reason to put this love on the line again
Can't believe that it's true
Now I'm one step out of time
When I sleep
I dream of you
You're in my mind
In everything I do
Well I still don't feel that it's over
I know what's right
Could be with you
Holding you tight
Now that you've gone
Won't you tell me
Where I've been going wrong
One step out of time
One reason to put this love on the line again
Can't believe that it's true
Now I'm one step out of time
Another week
Another day
When I call
You're miles away, daddy
Daddy now, you're still it's over
One step out of time
One reason to put this love on the line again
Can't believe that it's true
Now I'm one step out of time
One step, One step out of time
One step out of time

"Moustache" - Twin Twin
I miss something, but what?
I want this, I want that
When I sleep, I dream of dollars
Everyday I have a new suit

With me everything is new, everything is beautiful
The world weeps behind my curtains
I do not care I live on the top floor
I do not even know my housekeeper

There’s leather in my car
The smell of my fragrance reassures me
I don’t like showing my emotions
At the gym I lift some weights
My body is a war machine
I have everything you dream to have
I may be all that is true but

I want a moustache, Moustache
I wanna have a moustache, a moustache,
a moustache, want a moustache

I want this, I want that
There’s never enough for me
It’s like this, it’s like that
There is always something I don’t have

I want this, I want that
It’s like this, it’s like that
I want this, I want that
It’s like this, it’s like that
There is always something I don’t have

So I still add Tonnes of things behind my closet
I have friends still
And I even have friends who love me

I tell myself I have it all
I have everything, I have the world at my feet
This is crazy
I have everything you dream you have
I may be all that is true but

I want a moustache
Moustache
I wanna have a moustache, a moustache,
a moustache, want a moustache

I want this, I want that
There’s never enough for me
It’s like this, it’s like that
There is always something I don’t have

I’d give everything I have for a moustache
Now I know
What I want is a moustache

I’d leave everything
Give it all For a moustache
I may be all that is true
But this is not what I wanted

I want this, I want that
There’s never enough for me
It’s like this, it’s like that
There is always something I don’t have
But I wanted a moustache

LISA ANDREAS – STRONGER EVERY MINUTE (2004, ISTANBUL)

No matter where I am
I'm always thinking of you
It may be hard, but I need you to understand
That I don't often say what I feel
But now this is straight from my heart
My love grows stronger every minute
And it won't ever die
I want you to stay with me
Not just this day, but for all my life
Now, when I look into your eyes
I can tell there's something wrong
You're holding back the tears
Couldn't bare to lose you now
So I will make my feelings clear
My love grows stronger every minute
And it won't ever die
You must believe I'll always be there
For you, all my life
Oh... please stay
Mmm...
My love grows stronger every minute
And it won't ever die
I want you to stay with me
Not just this day, but for all my life
Oh... please stay

I Belong' by Kathy Kirby - United Kingdom (1965)

I belong, I belong, I belong
Since half my life, my heart’s been sleepin’
For all this time, my love’s been keepin’
But now my heart has recovered
From past affairs that turned wrong
All my dreams are uncovered
I belong, I belong, I belong
At first, I thought – just one more lover
But then I found why he’s like no other
And now my heart has recovered
From past affairs that turned wrong
All my dreams are uncovered
I belong, I belong, I belong
Too many hours slipped away
Too many loves came my way
But they only broke my heart in two
While it needed someone just like you
At last you came, and from now on
The two of us would be as one
Yes, now my heart has recovered
From past affairs that turned wrong
All my dreams are uncovered
I belong, I belong, I belong
I belong

Texas Lightning – No No Never (Germany, 2006)
My love is stronger now than you'll ever know
And it won't ever let you go
My love is wider than the ocean can be
And it's deeper than the deep blue sea
My love goes higher than a mountain can rise
And I see it there in your eyes
My love gets tougher when the going gets rough
And believe me, I've got more than enough
Keep tryin' babe, keep holding on
There's a place we belong
Where things are good, where love is strong
I'm never ever gonna leave you to cry on your own
Never ever gonna not go and pick up the phone
I'm never ever gonna let you be chilled to the bone
No, no, never
No, no, never
I'm never ever gonna leave when you're lost in the storm
Never ever gonna not keep you safe where it's warm
I never ever will desert you when your heart is torn
No, no, never
No, no, never
My love shines brighter than a twinkling star
Baby no matter where you are
And my love keeps burning like an eternal flame
You can feel it, when I'm calling your name
Keep tryin' babe, keep holding on
There's a place we belong
Where things are good, where love is strong
I'm never ever gonna leave you to cry on your own
Never ever gonna not go and pick up the phone
I'm never ever gonna let you be chilled to the bone
No, no, never
No, no, never
I'm never ever gonna leave when you're lost in the storm
Never ever gonna not keep you safe where it's warm
I never ever will desert you when your heart is torn
No, no, never
No, no, never
I'm never ever gonna leave you to cry on your own
Never ever gonna not go and pick up the phone
I'm never ever gonna let you be chilled to the bone
No, no, never
No, no, never
No, no, never
No, no, never

'Everything' by Anna Vissi - Greece (2006)
I can hear my heart breaking
As I open the door
I can feel the tears on my face
Burn like fire
As I look in your eyes
And I know
I'm still in love with
Everything I hate
Everything you do
Everything I fear
Everything on you
Baby, Baby
I'm still in love with
Everything I hate
Everything you do
Everyhing I fear
Everything on you
Everything I hate
Everything you do
Everything I fear
Everything on you
I can feel my life ending
As I whisper goodbye
And I know
I'm still in love with
Everything I hate
Everything you do
Everything I fear
Everything on you with
Everything I hate
Everything you do
Everything I fear
Everything on you
I can't believe I still need you
I can't believe I still want you
I can't believe life means
Nothing without you
Baby I'm still in love
Still in love still in love with
Everything I hate
Everything you do
Everything I fear
Everything on you with
Everything I hate
Everything you do
Everything I fear
Everything on you

The Ark – The Worrying Kind (Sweden, 2007)
Moves, I like to make them
Grooves, I like to shake them
Shake me from my troublesome mind
Cause sometimes you'll find
That I'm out of my mind
You see baby, I'm the worrying kind
Words, I like to break 'em
Words I'd like to shake 'em
Shake them from my troublesome mind
And you turn up your nose
It's a joke you suppose
But baby, I'm the worrying kind
So if you see me somewhere
With that glassy ol' stare
And the panic and fear in my eyes
Don't call for first aid or the fire brigade
Or the local police cause they won't care
I'm just a silly old boy with my head in the can
I'm just a mortal with potential of a superman
But what sense does it make
When I feel like a fake
When I'm saying to you all be good for goodness sake?
Words, I like to break 'em
Words I'd like to shake 'em
Shake them from my troublesome mind
And why? -Heaven knows, It's a joke I suppose
But baby, I'm the worryin' kind
So if you see me somewhere
With that glassy ol' stare
And the panic and fear in my eyes
Don't call for first aid or the fire brigade
Or the local police cause they won't care
I'm just silly old boy with my head in the can
I'm just a mortal with potential of a superman
But what sense does it make
When I feel like a fake
When I'm saying to you all be good for goodness sake?
Ooh! Words, I like to break 'em
Words I'd like to shake 'em
Shake them from my troublesome mind
And why? Heaven knows,
It's Gods joke I suppose
But baby, I'm the worryin' kind
And You turn up your nose
And you say it's a pose
But Baby, I'm the worryin' kind
Yeah sometimes I'm blind
I'm just out of my mind
Baby, I'm the worryin' kind

Jemini – Cry Baby (UK, 2003)
Love, love's not enough
I need your trust
But you don't try anymore
Hun, you still turn me on
Though your love has gone
And I don't want to cry anymore
I thought our love would last forever

Not gonna settle for anything less, so...

Someone to hold me when things get rough
I need a love that's big enough
Bye bye baby
You lied to me baby
I must have been crazy
Baby bye bye
Cry, cry baby
You lied to me baby

Sébastien Tellier – Divine (France, 2008)
No no no no no no no
I'm looking for a band today
I see the Chivers anyway
Through my eyes
Oh oh oh
I… I'm alone in life to say
I love the Chivers anyway
‘Cause Chivers look divine
Look away
They try to find the Milky Way
They love to drink it every day
No no no no no no no
You… you and I, it's like you said
I'm not a Chivers anyway
You look fine
Oh oh oh
I… I'm alone in life to say
I love the Chivers anyway
‘Cause Chivers look divine
Look away
They try to find the Milky Way
I'm… I'm alone in life to say
I love the Chivers anyway
In your eyes
Oh oh oh
I'm looking for a band today
I see the Chivers anyway
I'll be a Chivers guy some day
In my mind
