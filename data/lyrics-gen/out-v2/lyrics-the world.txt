the world is not too big
the world around me can tell me lies
the world is beautiful
the world could be like it was meant to be
the world would be right
the world was about to begin
the world we live in
the world knows that Iâ€™m proud
the world is beautiful and right
the world I know
the world goes round and round
the world goes ding-a-dong, ding-a-dong
the world looks peaceful and charming
the world was just one
the world is ours
the world doesn't stop, but it does
the world would be a better place
the world is a beautiful place
the world is bigger
the world around you is filled with noise
the world lives within our reach
the world looks okay
the world is repeating itself
the world is falling apart
the world is a beautiful place
the world today is really crazy
the world will never be the same, oh yeah
the world is yours
the world is a beautiful place and you should make it
the world is a beautiful place
the world is made of stars
the world is my creation
the world is beautiful
the world that weaves
the world is just one piece
the world is a beautiful place
the world is bright
the world can be a beautiful place
the world has to make a change
the world could be crazy
the world still gives me wonder
the world around you seems to swing in circles
the world is yours and we are free
the world goes round and round
the world is awash
the world is not far
the world we are, the things you see in your eyes
the world is mine
the world will be better
the world is rough,
the world is so right
the world can be a mirror, mirror
the world has begun
the world is really bright
the world is our joke
the world is beautiful, the world is beautiful
the world is in white or black
the world is looking good
the world that you love
the world can be a lovely place
the world can be a beautiful place
