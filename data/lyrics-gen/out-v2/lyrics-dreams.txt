dreams and dreams of young girls
dreams, dreams, these are their own monsters
dreams show that it's true
dreams, fantasies, illusions
dreams I never knew
dreams still hold me inside
dreams are breaking down
dreams are not far from reality
dreams are opening wide
dreams and wonders
dreams awake and his words are too hard to say
dreams and fantasies, their emptiness is making the sky a happy place
dreams of tears and laughs of happiness
dreams in our dreams
dreams, dreams, all imagination
dreams don't fade away
dreams shining in your eyes
dreams and dreams that could save us
dreams always sound good
dreams have been lost
dreams are dreaming
dreams don't lie
dreams are cheap, they can lead me crazy
dreams and fears
dreams are beginning to fall
dreams are dancing till sunrise
dreams of love, something bigger
dreams that seem like they could be over
dreams are dreaming, dreams are dreaming
dreams still live on the wings of happiness
dreams calling the stars
dreams always tell the truth
dreams are dancing on their dark blue tumblid pillow
dreams in the mood
dreams, don't lose heart's desire
dreams don't matter
dreams are blue, dreams are grey
dreams just a dream
dreams we can hold on to
dreams are moving away
dreams are calling us
dreams are dancing, magic is dancing
dreams lost in all their glory
dreams always moving, time has come
dreams go crazy
dreams long gone, our dream is dead
dreams are moving away and the noise is getting louder
dreams and dreams fly,
dreams are moving away from happiness
dreams are ringing with emotion
dreams can take everything away, but it won't stop there
dreams and fantasies, we live in fear
dreams, dreams, illusions
dreams are turning in the sky
dreams of love, of breaking stars
dreams so beautiful
dreams rise in the sky
dreams like a dream
dreams never die
dreams shining bright like a light
dreams are bigger than
