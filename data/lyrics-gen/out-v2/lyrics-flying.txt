flying a flag for you and I
flying away, you are free
flying in the stream
flying the flag for peace
flying legs, feet, glistening, black wings
flying away so mad, off the face of reality
flying the flag for you
flying over the bridge of the sun
flying all day long
flying the flag to fly
flying like a trumpet
flying on the wings of love
flying away from home
flying away like my heroes did
flying in love at once
flying back to earth
flying wings of love
flying with blue wings
flying away from my reality
flying down, all the time flying up
flying back in the blue
flying me high and fly
flying with the lions
flying down the stairs
flying and be flying high
flying in my soul
flying away from your eyes
flying away but look within me
flying into love
flying on the wings of love
flying flying high
flying to the stars, I wanna fly high
flying wings of love
flying, I fly to your heaven
flying up in the sky like a cannonball
flying from this world that has gone apart
flying la la la la la la la la... dak da znam da da jastan (Kom)
flying out of my mind
flying away, fly away, fly away
flying to the stars
flying into action
flying away in the moonlight
flying away in fear
flying in fear but love keeps on coming
flying as one
flying away and get it all back?
flying flyin' high
flying away from here
flying, flying, flying, flying
flying the flag for love
flying through the black
flying out of the blue
flying though the wind is blowing
flying legs, fly wings, fly higher
flying back and facing the danger
flying, flying, flying
flying wings of love
flying with the stars of love
