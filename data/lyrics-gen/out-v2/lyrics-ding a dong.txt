ding a dong, ask if I want, if I want
ding a dong for me, I'll be yours forever
ding a dong, hold me till dawn, say you love me like a loving mother
ding a dong when you say your love for life ends
ding a dong with the beat and then it broke
ding a dong, put your money where your mouth is
ding a dong to wake you up
ding a dong, ring a bell
ding a dong to get your attention
ding a dong when your lover is gone
ding a dong and pick a flower
ding a dong to slow the rhythm
ding a dong, beat the drum and sing along
ding a dong, make a sound
ding a dong, a dong
ding a dong for me
ding a dong, if you wanna lose, just hold me tight
ding a dong, I wanna sing it
ding a dong to the girl that you played
ding a dong, tell me what's happening
ding a dong, just sing it like a hummingbird
ding a dong with that bird that perches on his rug
ding a dong, sweet song, thank you, darling
ding a dong when I'm beating on a string
ding a dong, make it stop and be gone
ding a dong, please, come and say goodbye
ding a dong to try and find my weakness
ding a dong to dance
ding a dong with your guitar, mmmâ€¦
ding a dong when he plays a dong
ding a dong, dance with my dolls, couleurs-toi?
ding a dong when I'm gone
ding a dong to raise your voice
ding a dong, hold me tight, oh come on
ding a dong, push it, baby
ding a dong that says that you love me madly
ding a dong with me, we'll be sorry
ding a dong with the tag on it
ding a dong with my song
ding a dong, ring a dinga dinga dinga
ding a dong for me
ding a dong for a beat and everyone will sing
ding a dong with me
ding a dong to add joy, because you make me sad
ding a dong, one, two, three
ding a dong and sing it like a hummingbird
ding a dong to catch my drift
