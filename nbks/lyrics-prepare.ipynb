see in there the biggest of the big fires\\nAnd so your hand clings to my skin where it wants to\\nIf you fly away one day, I would follow if I could\\nAnd if it had to be done, I would repel the winter\\nWith hard blows of springtime and long clear mornings\\nIf it had to be done to please you, I would stop the time\\nSo all your words of yesterday stay with me now\\nSo I still look into the blue of your eyes\\nSo your two hands still get lost in my hair\\nI will make everything bigger and if it’s too much or too little\\nI would be wrong all the time, if that’s what you want\\nI do want to give everything, if only you believe in it\\nMy heart does want to bleed, if only you see it\\nUntil being nothing more but the shadow of your nights\\nUntil being nothing more but a shadow that follows you\\nAnd if it had to be done\\n\\n\\nKoit Toome & Laura – Verona (Estonia 2017)\\nSleeping all alone\\nYou wake up with a bottle in your hands\\nNo sound of serenade cause we both know we
